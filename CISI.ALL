18 Editions of the Dewey Decimal Classifications
.A
Comaromi, J.P.
.W
   The present study is a history of the DEWEY Decimal
Classification.  The first edition of the DDC was published
in 1876, the eighteenth edition in 1971, and future editions
will continue to appear as needed.  In spite of the DDC's
long and healthy life, however, its full story has never
been told.  There have been biographies of Dewey
that briefly describe his system, but this is the first
attempt to provide a detailed history of the work that
more than any other has spurred the growth of
librarianship in this country and abroad.

Use Made of Technical Libraries
.A 
Slater, M.
.W
This report is an analysis of 6300 acts of use
in 104 technical libraries in the United Kingdom.
Library use is only one aspect of the wider pattern of
information use.  Information transfer in libraries is
restricted to the use of documents.  It takes no
account of documents used outside the library, still
less of information transferred orally from person
to person.  The library acts as a channel in only a
proportion of the situations in which information is
transferred.
Taking technical information transfer as a whole,
there is no doubt that this proportion is not the
major one.  There are users of technical information -
particularly in technology rather than science -
who visit libraries rarely if at all, relying on desk
collections of handbooks, current periodicals and personal
contact with their colleagues and with people in other
organizations.  Even regular library users also receive
information in other ways.

Two Kinds of Power
An Essay on Bibliographic Control
.A
Wilson, P.
.W
    The relationships between the organization and control of writings
and the organization and control of knowledge and information will
inevitably enter our story, for writings contain, along with much else, a
great deal of mankind's stock of knowledge and information.  Bibliographical
control is a form of power, and if knowledge itself is a form of power,
as the familiar slogan claims, bibliographical control is in a certain sense
power over power, power to obtain the knowledge recorded in written
form.  As writings are not simply, and not in any simple way, storehouses of
knowledge, we cannot satisfactorily discuss bibliographical control as
simply control over the knowledge and information contained in writings.

Systems Analysis of a University Library; 
final report and research project
.A
Buckland, M.K.
.W
    The establishment of nine new universities in the 1960's provoked a highly 
stimulating re-examination of the nature, purpose and management of academic
libraries.  Long-established attitudes and methods were questioned, but
although changes were made, the basic difficulty remained - a lack of objective
information about the best ways of providing a library service in a university.
The report of the UGC Committee on Libraries (the Parry Repot [267]), which,
in general, endorsed these changes, also stressed the need for research into
all aspects of academic library provision.

A Library Management Game:
a report on a research project
.A
Brophy, P.
.W
    Although the use of games in professional education has
become widespread only during the last decade, the method has
been used in a number of fields for many hundreds of years.
Its origins have been traced to simple war games, used in
military training when the "real thing" was either unavailable
or too dangerous.  In more recent times, these games have
become more and more sophisticated, and many now use large
electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved.
Since 1956, when the first well-developed management game was
introduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a wide variety
of disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education,
from primary school classes to courses for experienced professional
men and women.  One of the main causes of this "game explosion"
has been the rapid development of sophisticated management
techniques, such as simulation and mathematical modelling, which
have been made possible by rapid advances in computer technology.

Abstracting Concepts and Methods
.A
Borko, H.
.W
     Graduate library school study of abstracting should be more than a 
how-to-do-it course.
It should include general material on the characteristcs and types of abstracts,
the historical development of abstracting publications, the abstract-publishing
industry (especially in the United States), and the need for standards in the
preparation and evaluation of the product.
These topics we call concepts.
     The text includes a methods section containing instructions for writing
various types of abstracts, and for editing and preparing abstracting publications.
These detailed instructions are supplemented by examples and exercises in the
appendix.
There is a brief discussion of indexing of abstract publications.
     Research on automation has been treated extensively in this work, for we
believe that the topic deserves greater emphasis than it has received in the
past.
Computer use is becoming increasingly important in all aspects of librarianship.
Much research effort has been expended on the preparation and evaluation of
computer-prepared abstracts and extracts.
Students, librarians, and abstractors will benefit from knowing about this
research and understanding how computer programs were researched to analyze text,
select key sentences, and prepare extracts and abstracts.
The benefits of this research are discussed.
    Abstracting is a key segment of the information industry.
Opportunities are available for both full-time professionals and part-time or
volunteer workers.
Many librarians find such activities pleasant and rewarding, for they know
they are contributing to the more effective use of stored information.
One chapter is devoted to career opportunities for abstractors.

Academic Library Buildings
A Guide to Architectural Issues and Solutions

This book attempts to present representative examples of successful
architectural solutions to the important problems librarians and
architects face in planning new college and university library
buildings or in remodeling and enlarging existing structures.  It does
not attempt to make case study evaluations, as was done by
Ellsworth Mason for Brown and Yale.  Nor does it present examples
of unsuccessful solutions except to show how to avoid mistakes,
and in these cases the libraries will not be identified.

The Academic Library Essays in Honor of Guy R. Lyle
.A
Farber, E.I.
.W
     As important for staff members' individual development
as was the apprenticeship in administration, perhaps the most
significant attitude one acquired while working for
Guy was engendered by his insistence that librarians must
be interested in and knowledgeable about the content of the
materials with which they dealt.  His love of literature, his
respect for scholarship, his admiration for good writing and
reading were manifested in many ways, but most notably in
his admonition that, though we were primarily a research
library, we must constantly keep in mind our obligation to
collect contemporary poetry, fiction and belles-letters.  It
was primarily up to the library staff, he felt, to be
responsible for these as well as for "general" books which crossed
disciplinary lines or fell between the disciplines, those books
which a faculty mostly concerned with research materials is
apt to overlook.  And in building this portion of the collection,
"there is no substitute for a thorough acquaintance with
books through a reading of critical reviews and the books
themselves."  This counsel is from The President, the Professor,
and the College Library, but the importance of its thrust--the
need to keep up with the world of books and publishing--was
continually impressed upon us.

Access to Libraries in College
.A
Hyman, R.T.
.W
     This study assumed that an additional use study held
less promise than an analytical consideration of concepts.
The basic approach was a survey comparing traditional and
current professional ideas on direct access.  Principal data-gathering
instruments were documentary analysis and opinion questionnaire.
     Findings of the documentary analysis included the following:
     Research from 1890 to 1970 on the direct shelf approach
and browsing left the problems largely unresolved and
evidently resistant to established methods of use and user
research.  The need for an exhaustive study of concepts was
confirmed.
     Open shelf libraries--organized through shelf classification
and relative location--were meant to arouse the intellectual,
social, and political interest of the average citizen and affect
his democratic self-realization.
     Definitions of "browsing" varied greatly: self-indulgence
by the untutored in objectionable works; beneficial self-education
for the general reader; valuable guidance for the scholar in his
research.

Access to Periodical Resources
.A
Palmour, V.E.
.W
          The purpose of this study was to develop, evaluate,
and recommend a national plan  for improving access to periodical
resources.  About 48 percent of all academic interlibrary loans
are for periodical materials, with the bulk of the loans being
satisfied in the form of photocopies.  A major consideration in
the long-range improvement of the interlibrary loan system is
the possible augmentation with a national system for acquiring,
storing, and satisfying loan requests for periodical materials.
          This study focused on the physical access to the
periodical literature.  Based on the needs of the library community,
design features were developed, and included the following:
          Service should be made available to all users
          without any restriction other than access
          through a library.
          Initially, the service should be confined primarily
          to rapid, dependable delivery of photocopies of
          journal articles.
          The collection of a center should be comprehensive
          in subject coverage excluding only medicine.
          All worthwhile journals should be collected
          irrespective of language.

The Acquisition of Library Materials

Ford, S.
.W
  The scope of acquisitions work, outlined in the Introduction,
acknowledges the importance of selection policy,
serials recording, and other topics kindred to acquisitions.
These topics are discussed in this book only as they relate
to obtaining library materials.  They are examined thoroughly
in books and papers that are cited in the references and the
bibliographic note.
  Centralized acquisitions and automation of order routines are of
major importance in order work and they are reviewed as chapters in
this book.  These chapters are introductions to the concepts and
problems of centralization and automation, not manuals of practice.
For treatment of these topics in particular and in depth the reader is
referred to the references cited.  For automation these references
are only a modest selection from an enormous literature.

Acquisition from the 3rd World
.A
Clarke, D.A.
.W
  The Ligue des bibliotheques europeennes de recherche (LIBER) was set up
in 1971 as an international non-governmental organization, with the aim of
establishing close collaboration between the general research libraries of
Western Europe, particularly national and university libraries, and in
particular to help in finding practical ways of improving the quality of
the services these libraries provide.
  At the second meeting of its General Assembly, held in Luxembourg in 1972,
LIBER decided to hold a seminar on the acquisition of materials from the
'Third World'; and I was charged with the 'intellectual organization' of this
seminar.  The purpose of the meeting would be to examine the problems of
acquisition; the availability of materials in European libraries both for
reference and for lending; and the feasibility of setting up a European centre
for the collection of such material, to be available for loan.  The provision
of bibliographic information, preferable in machine-readable form, was to be
a basic consideration, whatever means were proposed for acquiring publications
from those areas.  The Council of Europe made a generous grant towards the
cost of the seminar which was held at the University of Sussex from 17 to 19
September 1973.

The Administration of the College Library
.A
Lyle, G.R.
.W
  If this book has a central thesis, it rests upon the simple but
frequently neglected principle that college library service goes
beyond the commonly accepted functions of book circulation and
storage.  The college library exists, not merely to house and
circulate library materials, but to supplement and extend the teaching
process with reference service, to afford faculty members library
opportunities for improving instruction, and to encourage students
to read more and better books.  Administration is essentially a
service activity, a tool through which library functions are more
fully and efficiently realized.
  The present work retains most of the material of the first edition,
but includes substantial revision in each chapter.  The book was
planned not only as a text in the teaching of college library
administration but also for independent professional reading.  Because
readers have found the footnotes and chapter bibliographies useful
for reference purposes, they have been brought up to date and in
some cases extended.

technical communication networks in the two laboratories results from the 
interaction of both social relations and work structure.. The sociometric 
"stars" in the technical communication network who provide other members of the
organization with information either make greater use of individuals outside
the organization or read the literature more than other members of the 
laboratory..

Adopting the Library of Congress Classification System
.A
Matthis, R.E.
.W
     This manual is designed to make it possible for any library to change
efficiently to the Library of Congress Classification system.  Detailed
procedures are outlined which may serve as exact models or as a series of
suggested steps which have proven effective in actual use.  Most of the text
deals with the necessary criteria for effecting the planning, making the
preparations, selecting the tools, and establishing the procedures which
are essential for a reclassification project.  Beyond this, considerable
attention has been given to many of the problem areas of the LC
Classification-series, biography, bibliography, law, PZ3 and PZ4.  In
addition, the literature Tables VIIIa and IXa, two of the most
frequently used tables throughout the entire class system, have been
thoroughly explained and their application illustrated by a series of
comprehensive examples.  Since the mechanics, production, and cost of
catalogue card copy can significantly affect the flow of books to users,
a chapter has been devoted to describing the use of Xerox copying
machines in library operations.  Finally, an annotated bibliography
of books and articles judged to be helpful in deciding to reclassify is
included for those readers who wish to delve more deeply into the
tortuous and frustrating 50-year history of the concept of centralized
cataloging and classification.  The numbers enclosed in parentheses
throughout the text refer to sources in the bibliography which relate
to or support the arguments being advanced in any particular case.

Adventures in Librarianship
.A
Voigt, M.J.
.B
1970
.W
  There has long been a need for a continuing series to provide
scholarly reviews of the rapidly changing and advancing field of
librarianship, a series which would select subjects with particular
current significance to the profession and provide an analysis of
the advances made through research and practice.  Advances in
Librarianship is planned and designed to fill this need.  It will
present critical articles and surveys based on the published literature,
research in progress, and developments in libraries of all types.
   Mechanization may appear to be the most obvious of the advancing fronts
of librarianship, for automation has caught the enthusiastic support of all
librarians who can visualize its potential.
Advances in this field will certainly be found in every volume of this series.
As the first group of articles in this volume demonstrate, technological change
has an obvious and direct implication for libraries, but the problem has been
found to be much more complex than the simple inventory problem many experts
expected.
Advances in Librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities of
automation, assessing where we are, where we are going, and how fast we can hope
to get there.
"The Machine and Cataloging" reviews the current status of the machine-produced
book catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of MARC.
Where business methods have greater applicability, progress is easier, as
reported in "Mechanization of Acquisition Processes."
Even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in the
future, not the past.
One of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization of
catalog information is that discussed in "Filing Systems for Computer
Manipulation."
This detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggests
possible solutions.
   For many years technical service costs have been defended without adequate
knowledge of the facts.
As automated procedures are proposed, standards are determining costs of
traditional operations become essential.
The article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficult
and reviews the significant advances of the past few years.
   The school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services much
more rapidly than other libraries, as reflected in its new name, the
instructional media center.
Here, technical change, together with new teaching methods, has made possible
major developments in library service in schools as well as for children in
the public library.
Two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated, and that
what remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception.
   Bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow.
   Articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerial
planning theory have for libraries.
The articles on the application of these concepts, which come from research in
administration, are provocative and may appear controversial to some.
   The article on library development in developing countries provides an
analysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting other
countries in providing the library service which is so important in the modern
world.

Selective Dissemination of Information
.A
Mauerhoff, G.R.
.B
1974
.W
  The present contribution does not duplicate previous studies but
complements the earlier publications and closes the few gaps that
exist in the literature prior to 1966 and after 1971.  Additionally,
it is a bold attempt to evaluate critically and objectively the history
of the mechanized selective dissemination of information (SDI) as
reflected in the literature, from the initial description by Luhn
(1958, 1961b, c) to the post-1970 period when the SDI boom began losing
ground to the more popular on-line interactive systems.  The review
therefore questions and interprets the concept of SDI, its implementation,
and its evolution in the light of work performed by many companies,
government agencies, universities, societies, and libraries during the
last fourteen years.

Adventures in Theory of Languages
.A
Herdan, G.
.W
  In trying to give an account of the statistical properties of
language, one is faced with the problem of having to find the
common thread which would show the many and multifarious forms
of language statistics - embodied in scattered papers written
by linguists, philosophers, mathematicians, engineers, each using
his own professional idiom as belonging to one great whole:
quantitative linguistics.
  The book stresses the peculiarity of statistics of language
structure as against just conventional statistics.  To put the
difference between two types of statistics briefly, the latter comprises
the methods and parameters of general number statistics as applied, e.g., in
Economics and Demography, the former has its own methods and characterising
parameters, particularly useful for describing and evaluating language
structure.  The idea of statistical linguistics as using concepts and
methods of its own, which was adumbrated in the author's "Language as
choice and Chance", 1956, has now taken definite shape.
  Of this development I shall try to give a brief account.  In my book,
"Language as Choice and Chance", the foundation was laid for a truly
sensible application of statistics to language by my interpretation
of the langue-parole dichotomy as being essentially that between statistical
universe and sample.

The Age of Jewett: Charles Coffin Jewett and American Librarianship
1841-1868
.A
Harris, M.M.
.W
     Most librarians mark the beginning of modern librarianship
from the founding of the American Library Association in 1876 and
the appearance on the national library scene of such dynamic and
controversial figures as Melvil Dewey and Charles Ammi Cutter.
     But in doing so, they overlook an extremely significant era in
the history of our profession, for the quarter century preceding the
1876 meeting in Philadelphia was one characterized by great advances
in the field of American librarianship.  This period of growth was to
have considerable influence on the course of library development in
America after 1876.  To ignore the third quarter of the nineteenth
century is to risk misinterpreting the pivotal post-1876 era,
and in this time of reappraisal, it seems particularly appropriate
and useful to focus our attention on the years preceding the founding
of the American Library Association.

On Aggression
.A
Lorenz, K.
.W
  In this book, Lorenz deals with the evolution of aggression
in vertebrates.  He points out that aggressivity is totally different
from predation: that it is a biological necessity for defence of
territory and for a cornered animal, and that it becomes mixed
up with other innate drives, thus leading up towards reduction
of intraspecific damage. This, be it noted, is most evident in
fiercer social predators like wolves, where escape from the pack
is virtually impossible and where co-operation without fighting
is necessary for survival; whereas in the non-social but proverbially
peaceful dove prevention of escape leads to violent and often
fatal attacks on the weaker mate.
  In a final chapter he advances some suggestion as to how in
the human species, where evolution is primarily cultural, and
not guided by Darwinian selection in the strict sense, the
aggressive drive may be canalized into less dangerous channels.
Man has innumerable ways of adaptively ritualizing his behavior,
many of them analogous, if not homologous, to those found in
animals.  In any event, On Aggression is a fascinating book by
a master of his subject.

Education and Manpower for Librarians
.A
Asheim, L.E.
.W
  This paper is not an official policy statement
of the American Library Association nor
of the Office for Library Education.  It is
simply an exploration, an outline of possibilities
for consideration by the profession.  Its purpose is 
to generate discussion that will lead
eventually to a statement of Association policy
that the profession will support and make
effective.
  A basic assumption on which the statement
rests is this: that the library occupation is
much broader than that segment of it which is
the library profession, but that the professional
segment has responsibility for the definition
and supervision of the training and education
required by the complete range of activities
encompassed by the occupation.  Librarians
are not the only persons who work in
libraries, but librarians are the ones who are
concerned with the advancement and improvement
of the library profession.  It follows then
that it is the obligation of the professionals
to engage actively in the establishment and
maintenance of standards and norms governing
the preparation of people who work at
any level in libraries.  They should define and
guide the kinds of preparation most useful at
the pre-professional level and not
merely the education of those who will hold
positions at the level we now call "professional."

staff regarding the extent of the problem of
missing books.  The findings of this study gave
the Ohio State University libraries concrete
evidence as to how many books are missing
and indicated the areas in which book losses
are the greatest.  These figures also provide
information which can be conveyed to the
faculty or administration when they voice

Algebraic Systems
.A
Maltsev, A.I.
.W
   As far back as the 1920's, algebra had been accepted as the science
studying the properties of sets on which there is defined a particular
system of operations.  However up until the forties the overwhelming
majority of algebraists were investigating merely a few kinds of algebraic
structures.  These were primarily groups, rings and lattices.  The first
general theoretical work dealing with arbitrary sets with arbitrary
operations is due to G. Birkhoff (1935).  During these same years, A.
Tarski published an important paper in which he formulated the basic
principles of a theory of sets equipped with a system of relations.  Such
sets are now called models.  In contrast to algebra, model theory made
abundant use of the apparatus of mathematical logic.  The possibility of
making fruitful use of logic not only to study universal algebras but
also the more classical parts of algebra such as group theory was
discovered by the author in 1936.
  During the next twenty-five years, it gradually became clear that the
theory of universal algebras and model theory are very intimately
related despite a certain difference in the nature of their problems.  And
it is therefore meaningful to speak of a single theory of algebraic systems
dealing with sets on which there is defined a series of operations and
relations (algebraic systems). The formal apparatus of the theory is the
language of the so-called applied predicate calculus.  Thus the theory can
be considered to border on logic and algebra.

Indexing and Abstracting by Association

Doyle, L.B.
.W
This article discusses the possibility of exploiting the
statistics of word co-occurrence in text for purposes of
document retrieval. Co-occurrence is defined and related
to the mental processes of authors and readers; several
means of quantitative measurement of word co-occurrence
are then scrutinized.  It is shown that the most
strongly co-occurring word pairs, which are therefore
"associated" in a statistical sense, can be represented
in the form of an "association map."  The last half of the
article presents two modes of use of association maps
in literature searching.

Cost Analysis and Simulation Procedures for the Evaluation
of Large Information Systems
.A
Bourne, C.P.
Ford, D.F.
.W
A computer program has been written and used which
simulates the several-year operation of an information
system and computes estimates of the expected
operating costs as well as the amount of equipment
and personnel required during that time period.  The
program has been used for the analysis of several
large systems and has proven itself to be a useful
research tool for the study of systems with so many
components and interrelated operations that an
equivalent manual analysis would be extremely
cumbersome and time consuming,and perhaps even
impractical. This paper describes this program and
shows, as an example, some of the results of a simulation
of two of several suggested designs for a specific
information system.

A Note on the Pseudo-Mathematics of Relevance
.A
Taube, M.
.W
  Recently a number of articles, books, and reports
dealing with information systems, i.e., document retrieval
systems, have advanced the doctrine that such systems
are to be evaluated in terms of the degree or percentage
of relevancy they provide.
  Although there seems to be little agreement on what
relevance means, and some doubt that it is quantifiable,
there is, nevertheless, a growing agreement that a fixed
and formal relationship exists between the relevance and
the recall performance of any system.  Thus, we will find
in the literature both a frankly subjective notion of 
relevance as reported by individual users, and equations,
curves, and mathematical formulations which presumably provide
numerical measures of the recall and relevance
characteristics of information systems.  This phenomenon
of shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjective
and non-mathematical term to equations in which the
same term is given a mathematical value or a mathematical
definition has its ancient parallel in discussions
of probability.  One cannot, of course, legislate the
meaning of a term.  It all depends, as Alice pointed out,
on "who is master," the user or the term.  On the other hand,
the use of a single term in the same document to cover
two or more distinct meanings, especially when such a
usage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrine
by attributing to it mathematical validity which it does
not have, represents a more serious situation than merely
careless ambiguity.

Some Questions Concerning "Information Need"
.A
O'Connor, J.
.W
The expression "satisfying a requester's information
need" is often used, but its meaning is obscure.  The
literature on "information need" in relation to
retrieval suggests three different (though not inconsistent)
possible interpretations.  However, each of these
interpretations is itself fundamentally unclear. The
various obscurities involved are indicated by critical
questions, which those who write of information need
are invited to answer.

Vocabulary Building and Control Techniques
.A
Wall, Eugene
.W
   The rationale is given for creation and maintainance by an information 
center of a controlled indexing and retrieval vocabulary.. Basic vocabulary
principles are (1) use of natural language, (2) development of hospitality
to new concepts, (3) provision of adequate cross-referencing, and (4)
formatting for easy use.. Terminalogical conventions necessary for development
and control of a useful vocabulary are summarized, and the techniques for 
applying these conventions to construct a thesaurus are described.. 
Computerized editing techniques and updating techniques are briefly set forth..

Attendance and Use of the Science Library at M.I.T.
.A
Bush, G.C.
Galliher, H.P.
Morse, P.M.
.W
This is an interim report on continuing
studies of library operations at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology being made by
members of the Institute's Operations Research
Project in cooperation with the librarians and
library staff.  In this report, which is based
on actual observations of on-the-premise use
made of the Science Library, various statistics
measuring the kind, degree, and intensity of use
are tabulated.  In addition there are some
suggested measures of effectiveness of the library.
A unique outcome of the survey has been the
construction and verification of a mathematical
model employing probability theory to measure
rate and kind of use of library material
together with length of stay of library patrons.
Such models, characteristic of an operations
research approach, give promise of furthering
the goal of effective library management and
planning.

Information Gathering Patterns and Creativity
A study of research chemists in an industrial research laboratory
.A
Maizell, Robert E.
.W
   A comparison of creative and "noncreative" research chemists with 
respect to the ways in which they use their professional and technical 
literature.. The creative chemists differ from the "noncreative" in that the
former read more technical literature on the job, are less reluctant to use 
literature of greater reading difficulty, are less influenced in their 
independence of thought, read more extensively and consult more frequently the
older material, are more inquisitive and have broader cultural interests.. The
findings of the study are believed to be helpful in planning library and 
information services, in refining future inquiries into the ways in which
scientists use recorded information, and in improving tests for the 
identification of creative ability among chemists..

Keyword-In-Context Index for Technical Literature (KWIC Index)
.A
Luhn, H.P.
.W
   A distinction is made between bibliographical indexes for new and past
literature based on the willingness of the user to trade perfection for 
currency.. Indexes giving keywords in their context are proposed as suitable 
for disseminating new information.. These can be entirely machine-generated 
and hence kept up-to-date with the current literature.. A compatible coding 
scheme to identify the indexed documents is also proposed.. In it elements are
automatically extracted from the usual identifiers of the document so that the 
coded identifier yields a maximum of information while remaining susceptible 
to normal methods of ordering..

Savage, T.R.
.W
An experiment was conducted to determine which of 
four types of lexical indicators of content could be
utilized best by subjects to determine relevant from
irrelevant documents and to answer a set of 100
questions.  The results indicate that there were no
major differences between the groups using complete
text and abstracts to select relevant documents, but
the group utilizing the complete text obtained a
significantly higher score on the examination.

The World's Technical Journal Literature:
An Estimate of Volume, Origin, Language,
Field, Indexing, and Abstracting
.A 
Bourne, C.P.
.W
A quantitative estimate is made of the magnitude of the
world's scientific and technical journal literature problem.
Using a number of basic sources of statistical information,
a composite picture is established to show such things as
the total volume, linguistic and national origins, breakdown
by subject field, and degree of coverage by the abstracting
and indexing services.

Machinelike Indexing by People
.A
Montgomery, C.
Swanson, D.R.
.W
A study of several thousand entries in a classified bibliography
of article titles (the Index Medicus) revealed that a
large proportion of the title entries contained words identical
to or synonymous with words of the corresponding
subject heading.  It is inferred that a major part of the
bibliography studied could have been compiled by a machine
procedure operating on titles alone, provided the
machine was supplied with a suitable synonym dictionary.

Kessler, M.M.
.W
This report describes the results of automatic processing
of a large number of scientific papers according
to a rigorously defined criterion of coupling.  The
population of papers under study was ordered into 
groups that satisfy the stated criterion of interrelation.
An examination of the papers that constitute the
groups shows a high degree of logical correlation.

   Results of the census of the world's scientific and technical serial 
literature, within the limits defined and based on an examination of published 
source material from countries throughout the world, reflect a total title 
population much lower than estimated before.. Distribution of this population 
by country, showing better than 50% of the total divided among six major 
countries,  is included and discussed, together with a broad subject 
distribution of serials for certain countries..

New Factors in the Evaluation of Scientific Literature 
Through Citation Indexing
.A
Garfield, E.

Sher, I.H.
.W
   More than one million citations from the scientific literature have been 
processed by the Citation Index Project at the Institute for Scientific 
Information.. The Project, sponsored by NSF and NIH, will be described briefly,
and new methods of using citation data for evaluation of publications will be
discussed..
   Summaries of statistical data, compiled by computer methods such as the 
following, will be given..
   1. Frequency of citation of one journal by another..
   2. Frequency of current citations to the past literature..
   3. Frequency of self-citation by journals and authors..
   4. Number of source citations per cited paper..
   5. Number of references per source paper..
   6. Number of papers published per journal..

The Notion of Relevance
.A
Hillman, Donald J.
.W
   Analysis of the problems of defining the mutual relevancies of queries and 
document-collections indicates that they essentially involve the problem of
conceptual relatedness.. In order to consider the later problem, the question 
of concept-formation is first discussed, which in turn requires a definition of
concept.. An extensional interpretation is suggested whereby a concept is 
associated with a class of conceptually-similar documents.. Users' similarity-
judgments then provide the empirical data for formal definitions of concept and
conceptual relatedness.. It is found, however, that certain very general 
difficulties rule out the possibility of defining concepts and their 
relatedness by the method proposed.. Since this method is based on human 
relevance-judgments, it seems a natural one to adopt, so that its collapse has
serious practical and theoretical consequences.. An alternative approach is 
therefore proposed whose elaboration will form Part II of this article..

The Consistency of Human Judgments of Relevance
.A
Resnick, A.
.A
Savage, T.R.
.W
   A comparison of the ability of humans to consistently judge the relevance 
of documents to their general interests from bases of citations, abstracts, 
keywords, and total text was made under controlled experimental conditions.. 
The results showed that 1) humans are able to make such judgments consistently,
and 2) the consistency of the judgment is independent of the particular base 
from which it is made.. Apparent inconsistency arising from judgments made on the 
basis of abstracts remains unexplained.. This experiment, as well as others
concerned with human evaluations of text material, leave unexplored the basic
problem of providing a metric scale on which such evaluations can be measured..

The Distribution of Term Usage in Manipulative Indexes
.A
Houston, Nona
.A
Wall, Eugene
.W
   A semi-empirical correlation, based on data from nine indexes, permits the
prediction of the percentage of terms in a manipulative index vocabulary which 
will be used to index any given number of documents.. This is a function of the
total number of index entries in the system.. A log-normal relationship, 
similar  to Zipf's Law, exists between total index entries and distribution of
term usage.. Based upon the correlation, optimum vocabulary size and growth rate
can inferred, as well as the most efficient arrangement of index entries in a 
storage medium.. The results agree well with published data and appear to be 
particularly useful for designers of mechanized retrieval or publication
operations..

Measuring the Reliability of Subject Classification by Men and Machines
.A
Borko, Harold
.W
   Procedures for measuring the consistency of document classification are 
described.. Three subject specialists classified 997 abstracts of psychological 
reports into one of eleven categories.. These abstracts were also mechanically
classified by a computer program using a factor score computational procedure.. 
Each abstract was scored for all categories and assigned to the one with the
highest score.. The three manual classifications were compared with each other
and with the mechanical classifications, and a series of contingency 
coefficients was computed.. The average reliability of manual classification 
procedures was equal to .870.. The correlation between automatic and manual 
classification was .766..

A Quantitative Measure of User Circulation Requirements and Its Possible
Effect on Stack Thinning and Multiple Copy Determination
.A
Trueswell, Richard W.
.W
   The strategy outlined in this article describes a possible aid to the 
librarian for thinning a library's stack according to the criterion of user 
needs.. The method uses the last circulation date as a parameter of user 
circulation requirements.. The resulting stack collection would, by design,
satisfy over 99 percent of the user circulation requirements and yet be of
minimum size.. Preliminary, but not yet fully validated research, indicates 
that the number of volumes in a library's holdings may be reduced by 60 to 70 
percent and yet satisfy well over 99 percent of the user requirements.. It may
also be possible to determine which books should have multiple copies in order
that user disappointment can be minimized.. The effective result of this 
approach is that there now may be a quantitative method of maintaining the 
library's holdings at a reasonable level and, in addition, a reduction in the 
disappointment of the user who is unable to find the book he wants because of 
use by another..

Improvement of the Selectivity of Citation Indexes to Science Literature
Through Inclusion of Citation Relationship Indicators
.A
Lipetz, Ben-Ami
.W
   Citation indexes to large bodies of science literature can often list far
more citing references under the known cited reference than the user can 
afford the time to look up.. By providing some additional information, beyond 
the minimal association of the citing reference with the cited reference, a 
citation index could provide the means of the user to select from a long list 
those citing references which are most relevant to his immediate search 
requirement.. Means of providing this selectivity are discussed.. Particular 
attention is given to the possibility of adding short codes to the citation 
entries which would be informative of the way in which the citing publication
is operationally related to the cited one (this method is an integral feature 
of the Shepard's legal citations).. A scheme of citation relationships of 
potential value to users of science literature is presented.. These 
relationships were tested on a sampling of physics literature.. The suggested 
categories include indicators of the relation of the citing reference to the
scientific process in general, as well as indicators of its relationship to the
cited reference in particular.. Assignment of the categories to a citation 
requires the exercise of judgment, as in subject indexing, but does not involve
the use of subject terminology.. An illustration is provided of the application 
from a citation index to physics literature..

The Norms of Citation Behavior: Prolegomena to the Footnote
.A
Kaplan, Norman
.W
   The publication explosion has focused renewed attention on the lowly 
footnote.. While we are all at least partially aware of the technical functions
of the citation for both the writer and the reader of the scientific paper, 
little is known about the norms operating in actual practice.. Even less is 
known about the operating norms with respect to the more sociological functions,
including the acknowledgement of intellectual debts or the conferral of 
recognition upon the works of others.. This paper reviews the state of our 
knowledge, raises questions, and proposes suggestions and hypotheses for 
studying the relationships between footnoting practices among scientists and
the social system of science..

Adaptive Information Dissemination
.A
Sage, C.R.
.A
Anderson, R.R.
.A
Fitzwater, D.R.
.W
   Computer dissemination of information offers significant advantages over
manual dissemination because the computer can use strategies that are 
impractical and in some cases impossible for a human.. This paper describes
the Ames Laboratory Selective Dissemination of Information system with emphasis
on the effectiveness of user feedback.. The system will accept any document, 
abstract, keyword, etc., in a KWIC or Science Citation Index Source format..
User profiles consist of words or word clusters each with an initially 
assigned significance value.. These values are used in making the decision to
notify a user that he may be interested in a particular document.. According to
responses, the significance values are increased or decreased and quickly 
attain an equilibrium which accurately describes the user's interests.. The
system is economical compared to other existing SDI systems and human
intervention is negligible except for adding and deleting profile entries..

An Experiment in Automatic Indexing
.A
Damerau, Fred J.
.W
   This report describes a method of indexing documents which is based on the 
assumptions, (1) that a subset of the words in a document can be an effective 
index to that document, and (2) that this subject can be approximated by 
selecting those words from the document whose frequencies are statistically
unexpectedly high.. The results of the experiment are encouraging, although not
definitive because any index set chosen must be tested by using it for 
retrieval from a large collection..

Comparative Indexing: Terms Supplied by Biomedical 
Authors and by Document Titles
.A
Schultz, Claire K.
.A
Schultz, Wallace L.
.A
Orr, Richard H.
.W
   The original aim of this study was to obtain objective data bearing on the 
much argued question of whether author indexing is "good".. Author indexing of
285 documents reporting biomedical research was scored by comparing the author-
supplied terms (author set) for each paper with a criterion set of terms that 
was  established by asking a group of 12 potential users to describe the same
document.. Terms in the document title (title set) were scored similarly.. The
average author set contained almost half of all the terms employed by more than 
one member of the user group and scored 73% of the maximal possible score, as 
compared with 44% for the average title set.. When judged by the method and 
criterion employed here, author indexing is substantially better than indexing 
derived from document titles.. The findings suggest that indicia supplied by an
author should serve scientists in biomedical disciplines other than his own 
about as well as they serve his disciplinary colleagues.. The general method
developed for measuring indexing quality may represent a practical yardstick of 
wide applicability..

.W
   This paper defines and describes the KWIC (keyword in context) index concept,
providing a history of the concept and of its literature.. It discusses 
variations of the index, such as the Bell Telephone Index, KWOC indexes, and 
the WADEX..
   The paper discusses improvements and variations to the KWIC index, such as 
manipulation of the index line, variations of the code, addition of 
classification information, combination of author index and title index, and 
improvements to the preparation of the KWIC indexes, such as improvement of 
titles and use of a thesaurus, and discusses improvement of the use of the KWIC 
index.. The paper discusses the usage of the KWIC index and comments on the 
future of KWIC indexes of the KWIC concept..

   A function was developed for the optimum distribution of indexing terms by 
the number of postings.. This makes it possible to transmit information with 
maximum efficiency.. The comparison of the actual distribution of the term 
groups with the calculated optimum distribution provides an objective measure 
for evaluating any indexing system with respect to its efficiency as 
information transmission channel..

Relevance Disagreements and Unclear Request Forms
.A
O'Connor, John
.W
   Disagreements about the relevance of documents to retrieval requests occur
because relevance judges differently interpret requests of documents.. Requests
may be differently interpreted because they are unclear.. Well-known types of
request obscurity are reviewed.. Less well known is that a request may be 
unclear because its form - "documents about subject S", "document answering 
question Q", etc. - is unclear.. 
   Explications are developed of the meanings of the request forms just given 
and several others.. A request of any of the forms discussed is interpreted to 
be for documents which support statements of a specified kind in a specified 
way.. Examples are given which suggest that some, perhaps all, "about S" 
requests are unclear.. Some ways of formulating clear question requests are 
given..
   Various ways in which documents may support statements are distinguished..
These depend on on such factors as parts of a document use, inference strength,
and background knowledge permitted.. Some possible clear support specifications
are indicated..

   Although a large number of Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) 
Systems have been planned, implemented, and tested over the past few years, 
insufficient attention has been given to the collection and interpretation of 
important data needed for evaluation.. We describe some of the defects common 
to almost all of the reported systems, single out one recent report for 
detailed discussion and argue in favor of collection and correct interpretation 
of data on one important and frequently overlooked evaluation factor..

as precision and recall, that have been suggested by other workers.. The new 
measure is based on calculations of the expected number of irrelevant documents
in the collection which would have to be searched through before the desired 
number of relevant documents could be found.. Its advantages are: (1) it 
provides  a single index of the property it attempts to measure; (2) it allows
for gradations of retrieval status, through the mathematical concept of a "weak 
ordering"; (3) it evaluates retrieval performance relative to random searching;
and (4) it takes into account the amount of relevant material desired by the 
requester..

A Literature Search and File Organization Model
.A
Leimkuhler, Ferdinand F.
.W
   A principle of sequential optimization in search theory distributes the 
search effort at each stage so as to maximize the probability of target 
detection with the effort expended thus far.. As an application of this 
principle to the search of pertinent items in a literature file, the file items
should be arranged in decreasing order of the probability that an item will 
yield the information sought.. Complete ordering in this manner may not be
feasible, and it is proposed that the files be partially ordered in search 
zones with some loss in search efficiency.. A model for assessing the relative
efficiency for partial ordering is developed and used to determine optimal zone 
sizes under an assumed target distribution pattern.. In this way, trade-off
between file organization effort and search effort can be meaningfully 
evaluated.. A representative target distribution function for search literature 
appears to follow the Bradford law of scattering.. This function is used to 
demonstrate the application of the model over a meaningful range of parameters 
obtained from empirical studies.. It is shown that a good two-zone search plan
to scientific literature is one in which 15-20% of the most useful documents 
are examined first.. Only about one of three searches should have to go on to a 
search over the remainder of the file..

The Publication Inflation
.A
London, Gertrude
.W
   The much-vaunted information explosion seems to be the manifestation of a 
rather generalized publication inflation.. Multipublication and pretentious
writing have become obstacles to "communication between human minds". To 
counteract their harmful effects it will be necessary to reduce the quantity 
and improve the quality of the printed records by filtering the material before 
it is stored for retrieval..

A Computer-Based Serials Control System for a Large Biomedical Library
.A
Roper, Fred W.
.W
   Rather than reiterate the obvious purposes and procedures involved in 
creating a computer system for control of serials, in this paper the author
deals with the concept upon which the UCLA system is based and the manner in
which the system is maintained in day-to-day operations of the UCLA Biomedical
Library.. The paper deals with some of the points made in an earlier publication
from the UCLA serials project.. The attempt is to show how the theory of 
publication pattern (discussed in the earlier article) has been used to 
produce a different idea in computer control of serials.. Publication pattern 
information which is entered into the master record for each title causes
check-in cards for the next expected issue of each title to be generated by the
computer, regardless of when this text issue is expected - next week, next
month, next year.. This is departure from most systems, which attempt to 
predict a certain number of issues which should arrive during a given time 
period.. The information, which must be a part of the computer record, is 
described, as are library procedures in maintaining the system..

A Study of Searching the Eye Research Literature
.A
Miller, Russell R.
.W
   The paper is a report of most of the major findings of a study in searching
the periodical eye research literature.. Questions were collected from eye 
researchers and a selected group of these were searched in nine different 
secondary sources.. Articles thought to be relevant were Xeroxed and sent to 
the eye researchers who subsequently rated the articles.. Articles of eye
research interest are found in a wide variety of journals, but a small number
of journals carry a large proportion of the articles judged valuable by the eye
researchers.. Approximately a fourth of eye research articles are in foreign 
languages.. Translations are not readily available.. Despite a delay of more 
than 15 month between the original appearance of article in journals and the 
mailing of photocopies, about half of the articles of interest to the 
researchers were not known to them previously.. For extensive retrospective
searches more than one secondary service must be used.. Index Medicus and 
Excerpta Medica (Section 12) or Ophthalmic Literature would be good sources..
MEDLARS demand searches were not shown to be clearly superior to manual 
searches of Index Medicus.. Titles, abstracts, and full text were shown to be
equally effective in permitting searches to retrieve references that were
subsequently rated as relevant by the researchers.. A searcher with a background
in ophthalmology was able to retrieve more articles of research interest than 
other non-ophthalmologist searchers..

Psychology and Information
.A
Miller, George A.
.W
   An aspect of the human use of information that has generally been overlooked 
in the automation in information services is the human tendency to locate 
information spatially.. Computer-based systems do not necessarily assign any 
unique role to spatial tags, and so a feature of considerable importance for 
the organization of the user's memory seems to have been largely overlooked..
The spatial dimension of human memory is discussed, and some suggestions are 
offered for exploiting it more effectively in the context of information 
retrieval services..

The Use of Simulation in Studying Information Storage and Retrieval Systems
.A
Baker, Norman R.
.A
Nance, Richard E.
.W
   Previous applications of simulation to information storage and retrieval 
systems (ISRS) have been overly restrictive in their scope and have failed to
consider the environment within which such systems operate.. This paper 
considers the ISRS as a subsystem within a larger system which includes the 
users and the funders of the retrieval system.. The three components form a 
closed-loop information feedback system in which user response influences both 
the funding and operation of the ISRS as it attempts to satisfy user needs 
within a finite budget allocation.. Reward-cost theory provides the basis for
describing user behavior.. An industrial dynamics model has been developed to 
simulate ISRS/user/funder behavior where a university departmental library is 
the ISRS component.. The results which such an analysis can produce are 
discussed..

Retrieval of Answer-Providing Documents
.A
O'Connor, John
.W
   (I) Better understanding of subject document retrieval might result if 
different functions of subject document retrieval system are studied 
separately.. This paper is concerned with retrieval of documents, in response 
to a question, from which answers to that question can be inferred 
("answer-providing documents").. "Answer can be inferred from document" has 
many possible meanings, one of which must be selected (an "inference 
specification").. Inasmuch as scientists in a field disagree about the 
correctness of inferences, have somewhat different background knowledge, etc., 
any inference specification can only approximate scientific inference 
practices.. Two sources of systematic knowledge of document-statement inference 
practices in a scientific field are described.. (II) If a content word occurs 
in a question, then it occurs in any answer to that question (with some 
apparently tractable exceptions).. An indexing procedure based on that fact is
described which would permit retrieval of all answer-providing documents for a 
question.. However, because the indexing is "nonrelational", it could cause 
false retrievals as well.. Various ways of dealing with such false retrievals 
are   briefly indicated, and a study is sketched that would provide data for 
helping selection among them.. Two special point concerning indexing for 
retrieval of answer-providing documents are discussed separately..

On Understanding User Choices: Textual Correlates of Relevance Judgements
.A
Gifford, Carolyn
.A
Baumanis, George J.
.W
   An empirical investigation of the role of documents in relevance judgements
is reported.. Abstracts previously judged relevant, partially relevant, and 
nonrelevant to each of 61 questions were compared to see whether textual 
differences could be found which might reasonably account for the rating 
differences.. The results of this comparison were fairly clear-cut 
characterizations in each case of relevant and partially relevant abstracts.. 
These characterizations were found to be expressible largely as meaningful
co-occurrences of terms closely related to the question.. It is suggested that 
the textual bases of user choices may be more understandable than has been 
supposed..

Word-Word Associations in Document Retrieval Systems
.A
Lesk, M. E.
.W
   The SMART automatic document retrieval system is used to study association 
procedures for automatic content analysis.. The effect of word frequency and 
other parameters on the association process is investigated through examination
of related pairs and through retrieval experiments.. Associated pairs of words
usually reflect localized word meanings, and true synonyms cannot readily be
found from first or second order relationships in our document collections.. 
There is little overlap between word relationships found through associations 
and those used in thesaurus construction, and the effects of word associations 
and a thesaurus in retrieval are independent.. The use of associations in 
retrieval experiments improves not only recall, by permitting new matches 
between requests and documents, but also precision, by reinforcing existing 
matches.. In our experiments, the precision effect is responsible for most of 
the improvement possible with associations.. A properly constructed thesaurus,
however, offers better performance than statistical association methods..

Effectiveness of Information Retrieval Methods
.A
Swets, John
.W
   Results of some 50 different retrieval methods applied in three experimental 
retrieval systems were subjected to the analysis suggested by statistical 
decision theory.. The analysis validates a previously-proposed measure of
effectiveness and demonstrates its several desirable properties.. The 
examination of a wide range of data in relation to this one metric provides a 
clear and general assessment of the current state of the retrieval art..

Managerial Cost Accounting for a Technical Information Center
.A
Helmkamp, John G.
.W
   The purpose of this paper is to describe a research project conducted at a 
technical center to test the hypothesis that: A theoretically-sound managerial 
cost-accounting system can be designed to meet the specific characteristics of 
a technical information center by revising and innovating systems utilized by 
other enterprises.. A computerized cost system was developed and operated for
a three-month period to test this hypothesis.. The results of the study 
indicate that effective managerial cost accounting is possible for a technical
information center.. Relevant cost information was generated periodically to 
measure the operating performance of the center's production process.. A 
summary of the data that were reported regularly to management is presented 
in this paper..

Leith, John D. Jr.

   The author's journal reference cards for 1965 and 1966 were analyzed 
according to three "interest patterns": (I) the total collection of 1469 
article titles, a "potentially useful" set; (II) a subset concerning only his
research speciality; and (III) a subset of articles defined as "useful". For
each pattern, journals were ranked by frequency of use and a scatter diagram 
was drawn..
   Patterns I and II largely resembled patterns obtained by counting citations
in basic journals or by counting publications of selected researchers.. Pattern 
III was more widely scattered..  It is concluded that access to diverse 
journals is needed by researchers to supply new ideas, and that this diversity 
of reading is not reflected adequately by citation counting or other indirect 
means..
   Current Contents, used by the author for current-awareness purposes in 
building his card file, generated 88% of all articles.. Scatter diagrams 
indicated the decreased scatter predicted from its use..
   The 30% most important journals in this collection, including about 80% of
titles, are ranked for each pattern..

The Effectiveness of Automatically Generated Weights and 
 Links in Mechanical Indexing
.A
Artandi, Susan
.A
Wolf, Edward H.
.W
   Work concerned with the statistical evaluation of the output of the MEDICO 
automatic indexing method is described.. The statistical test were designed
primarily to examine the validity of the assumptions which formed the basis of 
the algorithms developed for the automatic computation of weights and for the 
automatic generation of links between index terms and modifiers.. This 
evaluation also includes a comparison of the output generated from full text 
and from the processing of the abstracts or summaries of the same articles..

On-Line Access to Information: NSF as an Aid to the Indexer/Cataloger
.A
Bennet, John L.
.W
   When adding a document to a collection, an indexer should choose a 
representation which makes evident both the content of the document and its 
relation to other documents already in the collection.. Toward this end, the 
Negotiated Search Facility (NSF) makes possible indexer-controlled retrieval of 
information from a collection data base using tools beyond those available in a
traditional bibliographic catalog.. The design philosophy of NSF is to offer a 
framework to guide the indexer while allowing him freedom to retrieve any data 
which he judges will help him make indexing decisions.. An example which 
indicates how an indexer might use the facility also shows how the display
formats and command language promote interaction.. While the discussion is 
directed toward indexing, it should be clear that the facility would be equally
useful to the searcher..

Computer Selection of Keywords Using Word-Frequency Analysis
.A
Carroll, John M.
.A
Roeloffs, Robert
.W
   A statistically based method for automatically identifying keywords in 
machine-readable text has been developed which produces keyword lists that 
agree better with composite lists produced by panels of human indexers than do 
lists produced by five statistical criteria previously suggested, and also 
better than lists produced by most of the individual panel members.. The method
makes use of both the in-document word-occurrence frequency and the in-corpus
relative occurrence frequency as measures of word importance.. Each statistical
criterion was compared with the performance of human indexers by the use of rank
correlation statistics.. The simple word count was found to be superior to the
other four previously suggested criteria - all of which made use of the 
in-corpus relative occurrence frequency.. The test were conducted over 19
documents dealing with the subject of Information Science, a total of over 
66,000 word occurrences.. Seventeen indexers representing eight different 
information centers participated in experiments..

A Graphic Catalog Card Index
.A
Lewis, Elizabeth M.
.W
   To improve accessibility and maintenance of art slides in the United States
Military Academy Library at West Point, a model card with a graphic image of 
the slide was designed with pertinent identifying information displayed 
directly above a black-and-white opaque photo and also key-punched into it.. 
The card serves for ample comparison reference previous to handling the slides
and can produce a subject-arranged permuted index in book form.. The later 
permits access from the approach of form, geographic area, name, time of 
origin, artist, school, or style, etc.. Some added advantages, common to other 
kinds of graphic collections, are detailed.. Estimated costs of 
photo-reproduction of original cards, various kinds of copies, and computer 
time and materials are listed.. Future benefits from a consistent, unified 
cataloging system for graphic objects and the dissemination of this kind of 
information in a network structure are indicated as major goals..

Indexing Consistency and Quality
.A
Zunde, Pranas
.A
Dexter, Margaret E.
.W
   A measure of indexing consistency is developed based on the concept of 
"fuzzy-sets".. It assigns a higher consistency value if indexers agree on the 
more important terms.. Measures of the quality of an indexer's work and 
exhaustivity of indexing are also proposed.. Experimental data on indexing 
consistency is presented for certain categories of indexers; and consistency,
quality, and exhaustivity values are compared and analyzed.. The analysis of 
indexing exhaustivity leads to the conclusion that the increase of information
as a result of group indexing is a process analogous to Bradford's law of
information scattering, Lotka's law of scientific productivity, and Zipf's law
of vocabulary distribution..

Is Interindexer Consistency A Hobgoblin?
.A
Cooper, William S.
.W
   It is often assumed that the amount of interindexer consistency experienced 
under a given method of indexing is somehow indicative of the quality of the 
indexing.. To explore this assumption, two hypotheses are stated concerning the 
possible connection between interindexer consistency and indexing quality.. A
specific counter-example is then exhibited which shows both hypotheses to be
invalid.. Although a mathematical analysis of the counterexample yields certain
insights, the general relationship between interindexer consistency and 
successful retrieval is more subtle than might have been expected.. It is
concluded that until equations describing this relationship have been derived, 
measurements of inter-indexer consistency will have little meaning as clues to
indexing quality..

The Cost Analysis of Document Surrogation:  A Literature Review
.A
Landau, Herbert B.
.W
   A state-of-the art literature review on the cost of classification, 
cataloging, indexing, and abstracting has been included.. It was found that
while some data on specific costs are available, the literature is generally
found lacking from the point of view of accuracy, completeness, consistency,
and availability..

Some Independent Agreements and Resolved Disagreements 
   About Answer-Providing Documents
.A
O'Connor, John
.W
   Eighty-two documents and 30 questions, in documentation and related areas, 
was compared to find answer-providing documents (documents from which answers to 
questions can be inferred).. Two judges (documentation experts) made 
comparisons independently.. They discussed their disagreements, attempting to
resolve them.. In each case the positive judge was first asked to indicate what
answer he inferred, and from what document passage(s).. The further discussion
depended on the details of each case.. In general, the resolution procedures 
used will resolve a disagreement about whether a document is answer-providing
or reduce it to a familiar kind of scientific disagreement (about a passage's
meaning, a statement's correctness, or an inference's correctness).. This seems
better than treating relevance judgements as subjective and not open to 
rational discussion..

Information Science: Toward the Development of a True Scientific Discipline
.A
Yovits, M. C.
.W
   It is pointed out that if information science is to be considered a "true" 
science similar to physics or chemistry then it must have a set of concepts and
analytical expression which apply to the flow of information in a general way..
In several previous papers, the author and a colleague have described a model 
of a generalized information system which has  wide, and perhaps universal 
applicability.. This paper elaborates on this model and indicates the range of 
its applicability.. Several fundamental quantities are defined specifically in 
a way which allows for quantification.. It is pointed out in this paper that 
this model can be the basis for the development of a "true" science of 
information with all of the necessary requirements for a science.. By the use 
of this model and the definition of a "true" science, the goals and requirements 
for a curriculum in information science are thus established.. Within this 
context, information is defined as data of value in decision making.. 
Quantitative measures of information can be obtained by relating information to 
specific observable actions which can be measured physically..

A Comparison of a Keyword from Title Index with a Single Access Point 
 per Document Alphabetic Subject Index
.A
Jahoda, G.

Stursa, Mary Lou
.W
   Two indexes to a collection of 3,204 documents in the field of chemistry 
were  test-searched.. The indexes are a keyword from title index without added
keywords and a single access point per document alphabetic subject index.. The
indexes were searched by 13 graduate chemistry students using 55 questions..
Search results are characterized in terms of recall, precision, and search 
time.. There is no statistically significant difference in recall and precision
search result between the multiple access points per document keyword from 
title index and the single access point per document alphabetic subject index..
Search time was significantly better for the alphabetic subject index for all 
but those questions having only one relevant document..

Patterns of Name Ordering among Authors of Scientific Papers:
A study of Social Symbolism and Its Ambiguity
.A
Zuckerman, Harriet A.
.W
   With increasing scientific collaboration, visibility of individual 
role-performance has diminished.. Ordering of author' names as an adaptive 
device which symbolizes their relative contributions to research.. Interviews 
with Nobel laureates and comparisons of their name-order practices to those of 
other scientists suggest that this symbol is ambiguous and makes evaluation of 
individual role-performance difficult.. A probability model of expected 
distribution of name orders is used in measuring preferences for particular 
sequences, and these preferences vary with the authors' eminence.. On the 
assumptions that authors' names are listed in order of the value of their 
contributions, laureates should be first-authors more often than other 
scientists; in fact, they are not.. Instead, they exercise their noblesse 
oblige by giving credit to less eminent co-workers increasingly as their 
eminence grows.. They do so more often after the prize, and eminent 
laureates-to-be forego first-authorship more often than  those as yet 
unrecognized.. The noblesse oblige, however, has its limits; laureates' 
contributions to prize-winning research are more visible than contributions to 
their other research..

Professional Standing and the Reception of Scientific Discoveries
.A
Cole, S.
.W
  The Matthew Effect occurs when scientists receive differential recognition
for a particular scientific contribution depending on their
location in the stratification system.  Merton originally introduced
the concept to explain the allocation of credit among authors of
multiple discoveries or collaborators.  In this paper the concept is
generalized to apply to all scientific work.  If the Matthew Effect
were to operate, the reception of papers of equal quality should be
influenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system.
To test this hypothesis, data are drawn from several studies of
similar design.  In each study we control for the number of citations
papers received at time 2.  This enables us to look at groups of
papers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2.
We then see whether there were any differences in the reception of
these papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the author's
location in the stratification system.  All the data indicate
that assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more important 
determinant of a paper's initial reception than any of the stratification
variables.  However, the speed of diffusion of papers of equal quality
is influenced by the reputation of the author based on past work
that is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery.  The
Matthew Effect also operates for those scientists located at prestigious
points of the social system of science.  All other stratification
variables, including eminence as measured by receipt of awards
did not influence the speed of diffusion.  Data are presented that
indicate that top papers written by high-ranking scientists are no 
more likely to be widely diffused early than are top papers by low-
ranking scientists.  The Matthew Effect also serves to focus
attention on the work of little-known men who collaborate with
scientists of high repute and to increase retroactively the visibility
of the early work of scientists who go on to greater fame.  A discussion
is included of the relevance of these data for the study of
resistance to scientific discoveries.

Involving, Computerizing, Personalizing
.A
Kilgour, F.
.W
  In most libraries most users face a complex, monolithic arrangement
of entries in catalogs and books on shelves.  In classical librarianship no
effort can be made to personalize the listing of titles or arrangement of
volumes for an individual user.  A user is unidentified, and, except for
that small fraction of a percent who consult reference librarians, users 
remain nameless.
  The computer, however, with its superb ability to treat users as
individual persons and events as individual events, possesses the potential
for enabling big libraries to recapture the human qualities of
which classical librarianship has deprived them since their days as
one-librarian libraries.  However, rehumanization is not the only
contribution computerization will make to libraries.
  Developments in modern society are forcing libraries to establish new
objectives.  Contemporary living is information based, a phenomenon
that is outmoding the venerable concept of library function.  As small special
libraries already do, all libraries must participate in the cultural
activities of the individuals in their communities rather than
merely make available a torpid "service." Libraries must look forward to
supplying information to a user when and where he needs it - an
objective impossible to attain with classical library techniques.

OCLC for You - and ME?!
.A
Plotnick, A.
.W
  Sometimes it seems as if the library world has divided into two camps; those
who seem to know all about this thing called "OCLC" and who keep popping that
rounded acronym into their conversation with a certain bromidic effervescence,
and the other camp - plain folk who are happy to take library life one
acronym at a time, as they need it, and who, if pressed, might guess that OCLC
has something to do with, oh, Optical Codes at the Library of Congress?
  Only in Ohio - where the Ohio College Library Center began and where
this national, computerized, bibliographic data exchange continues to grow -
is OCLC universally a library household term, even among computer-phobes.  In
Ohio, most librarians already realize the kind of thing going on at OCLC is
not simply the building up of someone else's data base in little bits and bytes,
but perhaps the biggest revolution in access to library collections since books
were unchained from the shelves.

The American Occupational Structure
.A
Blau, P.M.
.W
  This book is the result of a collaborative effort extending over seven
years.  We have tried hard to make the book a genuine joint product
to which each of us made the contributions he is best qualified to
make.  There is no senior author; the sequence of name is simply
alphabetical, and we have reversed it in signing the preface and elsewhere
to emphasize this fact.  Our collaboration was motivated by our shared
interest in social stratification, our common concern with advancing
scientific social theory on the basis of systematic research, and the
conviction that the inquiry would benefit from the different qualifications
and viewpoints the two of us represent.  There can be no doubt
that our interests in and approaches to sociological problems differ to
a considerable degree.  Although we agree that refining research methods
and advancing social theory are both important, for example, it is
only fair to state that Duncan lays more stress on deriving theoretical
generalizations.

American Overseas Library Technical Assistance, 1940-1970
.A
Brewster, B.J.
.W
     The United States has been engaged in activities known
variously as technical assistance, technical cooperation, or
development assistance for the past twenty-five years.  This
form of foreign aid, either government sponsored or privately
supported, is a twentieth century phenomenon.  The broader
concept, foreign aid or foreign assistance, means providing 
another country with any kind of goods, whether financial,
commodity, or manpower, to almost any purpose, and
extends to antiquity.  Technical assistance, which may be
defined, on the other hand, as the supplying of techniques,
is an outgrowth of the industrial revolution and parallels
America's rise in the nineteenth century to world recognition
as an important industrial and trade power.  Government use
of such aid as an instrument of foreign policy, as well as
the integration of these private and public efforts in the foreign
assistance field, began to develop under President Roosevelt's
Good Neighbor Policy.  This integration soon expanded under
the new cultural relations program which the United
States implemented during World War II to offset the Nazi
propaganda and cultural offensive in Latin America.

Scientific Communication:  Five Themes from Social Science Research
.A 
Menzel, H.
.W
  The recent upsurge of interest in the behavioral aspects of scientific and 
technical communication and information flow has two distinct sources, a 
theoretical one in the development of communication research, and a practical 
one in the concerns of policy makers in scientific organizations and 
information services.
  For some time past, the attention of sociologists and social psychologists 
studying communication processes, once focused on so-called mass phenomena
and mass publics, has turned to the interplay of communication processes with 
more and more definitely delineated and mapped aspects of social structure.  
One aspect of this shift in interest has been the increasing attention paid by 
behavioral scientists to the systems supplying information of a specialized 
sort, and to the publics which are consumers of this specialized information. 
The scientific and applied professions have been most prominent among the 
publics so studied.

Communication Patterns in Applied Technology
.A
Marquis, D.G.
Allen, T.J.
.W
  The preceding papers have addressed themselves
to the study of information flow in a particular
stream of human activity which has been variously called
science, pure science, basic research, or
fundamental research, and which
is only secondarily, if at all, concerned
with the practical utilization of its products.
At this point it is appropriate to note that there is
a parallel activity which includes applied research,
exploratory development, and engineering development.
This second stream of research we will call technology.
Far more is known about the flow of information
among scientists than among technologists.  From
the knowledge that is available, however, we are
led to conclude that the communication patterns  
in the two areas of activity are not only largely
independent of one another, but qualitatively
different in their nature.  This difference is
reflected most clearly in the mechanisms by
which information is diffused within the two
sets of practitioners.  The present paper is
addressed to these differences and to a discussion
of the nature of the communication process between
science and technology.

Bibliographical Citation Characteristics of the Psychological
Journal Network in 1950 and in 1960
.A
Xhignesse, L.V.
Osgood, C.E.
.W
  The aforementioned studies are related to the
problem of information exchange in psychology.
Journals are a part of the formal channel of scientific
communication as well as storage elements for
the summary accounts of research undertakings.
Analysis of bibliographical citations thus can
reveal certain characteristics of the pattern of
information flow created by scientists in their
work.  The potential usefulness of this type of
investigation is increased when it becomes
possible to examine the trends through time of the
communication network under consideration, and also 
when different communication networks can be compared.
  The present paper deals with some of the
characteristics of bibliographical citations in the
same 21 psychological journals published both in
1950 and in 1960. The list of journals used, along
with the abbreviations to be used here, is given in
Table 1; it includes 8 journals published by the
American Psychological Association and 13 journals
published by other organizations.

Scientific Communication:
Its Role in the Conduct of Research and Creation of Knowledge
.A
Garvey, W.D
Griffith, B.C.
.W
  There is considerable apprehension today
within the scientific community over the
communication crisis in science.  The present
article, which attempts to clarify certain aspects
of the problem, overviews the data collected by the
APA Project on Scientific Information Exchange in
Psychology, together with data which we have
more recently obtained relative to other disciplines.
Such a reexamination of the data should help to
clarify APA's relationship to the many information
media involved in the communication process
which begins with research and ends with the
incorporation of research findings into psychological
knowledge.

Ecological Correlations and the Behavior of Individuals
.A
Robinson, W.S.
.W
  An individual correlation is a correlation
in which the statistical object or thing
described is indivisible.  The correlation
between color and illiteracy for
persons in the United States, shown later in
Table 1, is an individual correlation, because
the kind of thing described is an indivisible
unit, a person.  In an individual correlation
the variables are descriptive properties of
individuals, such as height, income, eye
color, or race, and not descriptive statistical
constants such as rates or means.
  In an ecological correlation the statistical
object is a group of persons.  The correlation
between the percentage of the population
which is Negro and the percentage of the
population which is illiterate for the 48
states, shown later as Figure 2, is an 
ecological correlation.  The thing described
is the population of a state, and not a single
individual.  The variables are percentages,
descriptive properties of groups, and not
descriptive properties of individuals.

Priorities in Scientific Discovery: A Chapter in the Sociology of Science
.A
Merton, R.K.
.W
  We can only guess what historians of the 
future will say about the condition of
present-day sociology.  But it seems
safe to anticipate one of their observations.
When the Trevelyans of 2050 come to write that 
history - as they well might, for this clan
of historians promises to go on forever -
they will doubtless find it strange that so
few sociologists (and historians) of the
twentieth century could bring themselves,
in their work, to treat science as one of the
great social institutions of the time.  They
will observe that long after the sociology of
science became an identifiable field of
inquiry, it remained little cultivated in a
world where science loomed large enough to
present mankind with the choice of destruction
or survival.  They may even suggest
that somewhere in the process by which social
scientists take note of the world as it is
and as it once was, a sense of values appears
to have become badly scrambled.

Social Factors in the Origins of a New Science: The Case of Psychology
.A
Ben-David, Joseph
.A
Collins, Randall
.W
   The uninterrupted growth of a scientific field depends upon the existence of 
a scientific community permanently devoting itself to the field.. Therefore, the
new idea is not sufficient to start the take-off into sustained growth in a new 
field; a new role must be created as well.. In scientific psychology, this 
occurred in the late nineteenth century in Germany.. Using Germany as a 
positive case, and France, Britain and the United States as negative cases, it
is shown that the new role resulted from academic career opportunities favoring
the mobility of practitioners and students of psychology into other fields, and
from the relatively low academic standing of speculative philosophy and its 
consequent receptivity to persons and ideas which promised to turn the study of 
the human mind into an experimental science..

Scientific Output and Recognition:
     A Study in the Operation of the Reward System in Science
.A
Cole, Stephen
.A
Cole, Jonathan R.
.W
   The relationship between the quantity and quality of scientific output of 
120 university physicists was studied.. Although these two variables are highly
correlated, some physicists produce many papers of little significance and 
other produce a few papers of great significance.. The responses of the 
community of physicists to these distinct patterns of research publication were
investigated.. Quality of output is more significant than quantity in eliciting
recognition through the receipt of awards, appointment to prestigious academic
departments, and being widely known to one's colleagues.. The reward system 
operates to encourage creative scientists to be highly productive, to divert 
the energies of less creative physicists into other channels, and to produce a 
higher correlation between quantity and quality of output in the top departments 
than in the weaker departments..

Nobel Laureates in Science:
 Patterns of Productivity, Collaboration, and Authorship
.A
Zuckerman, Harriet
.W
   Nobel laureates in science publish more and are more apt to collaborate than 
a matched sample of scientists.. Interviews with 41 of 55 laureates and 
comparison of their research output with the output of the matched sample 
indicate that these patterns hold at every stage of the life-work-cycle.. As
laureates report and as their publications collaborate, they exercise noblesse
oblige in arranging co-authorship in collaborative publications.. Receipt of 
the Nobel prize is followed by declining productivity and changed work 
practices, as a result of changed role obligations and activities.. Reductions 
in productivity are more severe for laureates who experience comparatively 
large increments in prestige through the prize than for those who were already 
eminent.. The prize generates strain in collaborative associations so that most 
of these terminate soon after the award..

Visibility and the Structural Bases of Awareness of Scientific Research
.A
Cole, Stephen
.A
Cole, Jonathan R.
.W
   The paper contains an analysis of several aspects of the communication 
process in science.. Using data obtained from printed sources and questionnaires
mailed to university physicists, the conditions making for high visibility of a
scientists' work are studied.. Four strong determinates of visibility were
found: the quality of work, as measured by citations; the honorific awards 
received for work in physics; the prestige of the physics department to which
the scientist belong; and speciality.. Quantity of output, age, and 
name-ordering patterns on collaborative papers have no independent effect on 
visibility.. Just as some physicists may be easily seen (i.e., have high 
visibility), other are in positions where they may easily see.. This latter
characteristic is called "awareness"..The data indicate that awareness is high 
in all sectors of the population studied.. Variables such as age, rank of 
department, and quality of work made for only minor differences in awareness.. 
We conclude that the communication system in physics operates efficiently..

Social Structure in a Group of Scientists:
 A Test of the "Invisible College" Hypothesis
.A
Crane, Diana
.W
   The existence of social organization within a research area may be inferred 
(a) if scientists who have published in the area have more social ties with one 
another than with scientists who have not published, and (b) scientists who 
have published in the area can be differentiated by degree od social 
participation within the area.. Using the mail questionnaire, sociometric data
on different types of scientific relationships were obtained from scientists, 
all of whom had published in a particular problem area.. Respondents chose
scientists who had not published in the area as often as they chose scientists
within the area.. Analysis of direct and indirect ties, using Cleman's method
for analysis of sociometric connectedness, revealed that a tie with one or more
of the highly productive scientists brought other scientists of less
productivity into a large network of influence and communication.. Similarities
between this type of social organization and that of the "social circle" are
discussed..

Growth and Decay Curves in Scientific Citations
.A
MacRae, Duncan Jr.
.W
   In a rapidly advancing scientific discipline, new contributions will 
supersede older ones.. This selection in favor of recent literature should be
observable in the distribution of footnote citations in a given discipline, by
age of article cited.. However, the age distribution of citations also depends
on the rate of growth of the disciplinary literature.. The effect of growth of 
the literature and of selection favoring recent articles can be separated, if
certain assumptions hold, by use of an exponential model that expands and 
clarifies earlier findings by Price.. This model provides a reasonably good fit
to age-distributions of footnotes in several disciplines, and its application 
suggest that citations  in sociology tend to refer to older articles than those
in the natural sciences..A parameter in the model, measuring the degree of
selectivity in favor of recent articles, can be estimated and may be useful in
comparative studies of the communication systems of various disciplines..

The Structure of Scientific Fields and 
  the Functioning of University Graduate Departments
.A
Lodahl, Janice Beyer
.A
Gordon, Gerald
.W
   Kuhn's concept of paradigm suggests that academic disciplines could be viewed
as technologies involving degree of task predictability.. A series of hypotheses
were developed in which relatively high paradigm development in a discipline was 
predicted to facilitate research and teaching through improved processes of 
communication and access to stored information.. Using questionnaire data 
collected from 80 university graduate departments, physicists and chemists were 
found to exhibit more agreement over field content, and to be more willing and 
satisfied to spend time with graduate students than sociologists and political 
scientists.. In addition, chemists were found to collaborate with larger 
numbers of graduate students in research than scientists in the other fields..
Two other aspects of scientific structure are discussed: the level of innovation 
being pursued within a field of a given time, and the degree of 
institutionalized differentiation of the field into subdisciplines..

Productivity Differences among Scientists:
  Evidence for Accumulative Advantage
.A
Allison, Paul D.
.A
Stewart, John A
.W
   The highly skewed distributions of productivity among scientists can be 
partly explained by a process of accumulative advantage.. Because of feedback
through recognition and resources, highly productive scientists maintain or
increase their productivity, while scientists who produce very little produce
even less later on.. A major implication of accumulative advantage is that the
distribution of productivity becomes increasingly unequal as a cohort of
scientists ages.. Cross-sectional survey data support this hypothesis for
chemists, physicists, and mathematicians, who show strong linear increases in
inequality with increasing career age.. This increase is highly associated with 
a changing distribution of time spent on research.. Another implication of 
accumulative advantage is also corroborated: the association among productivity,
resources and esteem increases as career age increases..

The Distribution of Social and Cultural Properties in Informal Communication
 Networks Among Biological Scientists
.A
Mullins, Nicholas C.
.W
   Informal communication among biological scientists forms a discernible 
social structure.. This research analyzes the relation of that structure to (1)
scientists' descriptions of their research and the orientations that underlie 
those descriptions, (2) social status in science, and (3) the formal social 
categories of science (i.e. discipline, department, and research organization)..
Each of the observed structures is contrasted with a random model.. Neither 
social status nor the formal social categories show greater association on the
social structure than to the random model.. The culture of science, on the other
hand, as represented by description of research and the orientations underlying 
those descriptions, shows very strong associations with the discerned network 
structures..

The Gatekeepers of Science:  Some Factors Affecting
the Selection of Articles of Scientific Journals
.A
Crane, D.
.W
  The norms of scientific behavior as
described by Merton include the
prescription that scientific achievements
are to be judged without reference to
scientists' social characteristics.  This
article will attempt to assess the extent
to which this norm is followed with
respect to the evaluation of articles by
scientific journals.

Bibliographical Reference Patterns in Core
Sociological Journals, 1965-1966
.A
Lin, N.
Nelson, C.E.
.W
  The present study attempted to extend previous work on
bibliographical reference patterns in sociological journals
in the following ways: (1) by selecting for study those
journals to which American sociologists prefer to submit
their work, (2) by including, over a two-year period, all
bibliographical references (journals, books, technical
reports, etc.), and (3) by including, for initial comparison,
a journal from the physical sciences.  Such a study, it was
hoped, would yield data concerning similarities and
differences among the sociological journals and between
the sociological journals and the physical science journal.

Sociology Today:  Lacunae, Emphases, and Surfeits
.A
Brown, J.S.
Gilmartin, B.G.
.W
  In sociology today, as in other sciences, the professional
journals serve as major channels for the dissemination of
ideas and information.  The papers presented in the
principal periodicals reach a wide audience among sociologists,
are acknowledged as the best work, and stand as
models for all who aspire to success.  The viewpoints, conceptual 
schemes, interests, and methodologies reflected in
these articles are therefore significant influences on both
the current character and the future development of our
discipline.

Measuring the Quality of Sociological Research:
Problems in the Use of the Science Citation Index
.A
Cole, S.
.W
The Problem of assessing the "quality" of scientific
publications has long been a major impediment to
progress in the sociology of science.  Most researchers
have typically paid homage to the belief that quantity of
output is not the equivalent of quality and have then gone
ahead and used publication counts anyway (Coler, 1963;
Crane, 1965; Price, 1963; Wilson, 1964).  There seemed
to be no practicable way to measure the quality of large
numbers of papers or the life's work of large numbers of
scientists.  The invention of the Science Citation Index
(SCI) a few years ago provides a new and reliable tool
to measure the significance of individual scientists'
contributions.  Starting in 1961, the SCI has listed all
bibliographic references appearing in an increasingly large
number of journals.  The number of citations an
individual receives may be tabulated and used as an indicator
of the relative scientific significance or "quality" of that
individual's publications.

  This book is intended to supply the background needed for
participation in the analysis and design of information-handling
systems and for understanding the literature in the field.
I have tried to present a unified approach to the subject
and to the relation of information retrieval to other
disciplines and an appreciation of the importance of this
interdisciplinary relationship.  I hope that the scientist
or computer programmer, newly interested in information-retrieval
problems, as well as the librarian, will find the book of value.

Analysis of Library User Circulation Requirements
.A
Trueswell, Richard W.
.W
   This research study is concerned with the use of the last circulation date 
as a statistic to help describe library user circulation requirements.. Some 
decision rules were developed to use this parameter as an aid in determining the
number of copies of books to be held in the library and as an aid in the
weeding of books from the library's holdings.. The effect of these decision
rules on the circulation requirements of users as well as on library operations 
are described.. The method of data collection is described in detail and is 
applicable at libraries having comparable charging systems.. Cumulative 
distribution functions of last circulation date at two large college libraries 
and a public library were prepared and have been plotted for both circulation 
data and stack holding data.. This same data has also been plotted by subdivided
subject category.. Circulation operating characteristics were prepared for all
three libraries..

   Due to the fact that scientific-technical research is constantly increasing,
it is becoming more and more difficult to retrieve the published results of 
research.. A new field of science, documentation, has been developed as a 
contribution to the removal of this difficulty.. Depending on the type and 
extent of the subject different methods for its documentation will be followed..
Methods and possibilities for the comprehensive documentation of chemistry and 
its related fields are explained..

TOSAR - A Topological method for the Representation of Synthetic and 
Analytical Relations of Concepts
.A
Fugmann, Robert
Nickelsen, Herbert
Nickelsen, Ingeborg
Winter, Jacob H.
.W
   In mechanized systems used for searching in literature stores there is a 
steadily growing necessity not only to be able to formulate concepts as a
search condition but also the characteristic connections under which these
concepts appear in the inquiry.. In this way the precision of the mechanized
literature search is considerably increased.. TOSAR has been developed in 
order to improve computerized literature searching in this respect..

  In the literature, active network plans and developments appear to cluster 
in three main areas: (1) Education, (2) Libraries, and (3) Government, Industry,
and Professional Societies.  These network groupings are described in this
chapter following a discussion of network definitions, concepts, and current
impetus.  References to information systems are included when there is an 
indication that a particular system will probably be transformed into a network.

Design and Evaluation of Information Systems
.A
Katter, R.V.
.W
  In corresponding chapters of earlier volumes of this review 
may be discerned a trend toward progressive broadening of
content coverage.  The initial emphasis was on design and
evaluation concepts and on techniques that were rather closely -  
and narrowly - connected with information storage and retrieval
systems.  It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that
there are many activities and ideas outside of this context
that have, or can have, a very important bearing on the work
of systems analysts, designers, and evaluators working on
library and documentation systems.  This chapter attempts
to continue enlarging our perception of the range of reported
activities that can help to improve the kinds of systems in which
our readers are chiefly interested.

Document Dissemination
.A
Landau, H.B.
.W
  This chapter is directed to those whose vocation (or avocation)
is information.  While we may call ourselves librarians, information
scientists or technologists, abstractors and indexers, documentalists,
IS&R specialists, literature searchers, and so forth, we all have one
thing in common: We are either directly or indirectly involved in the
dissemination of information.  As disseminators, we are interested
in far more than the techniques for transmission of information from
one point to another.  Despite McLuhan's (93) statement that "the
medium is the message," we must concern ourselves with not only the
means of document dissemination, but also the content and value of
the documents we disseminate.  This idea is prevalent throughout
most of the papers reviewed in this chapter.  A disseminator should
think of himself as a selective switching center, inputting data,
evaluating them, selecting worthy items, and directing and controlling
their transmission to a target: the reader.

Information Networks
.A
Overhage, C.F.J.
.W
  The rapidly growing rate at which information is produced and
used in our complex society has presented us with major problems
in information transfer.  We encounter these problems not only
in libraries, information centers, and schools, but also in many
of the operations of government and business.  The handling of large
amounts of information is becoming a dominant theme in the management
of our way of life.  We are a technologically oriented society, and
we have naturally turned to our communications technology to help
us perform our enormous information transfer task.  Beginning with
the telegraph and continuing through the telephone, through radio 
and television to the communications satellite, the methods of
electrical signal transmission have served to distribute information
to its ultimate users.

Annual Reviews of Information Science and Technology
.A
Cuadra, C.A.
.B
1972
.W
  In spite of concerns expressed in the literature about
the health and vigor of the field of information science and
of its service-oriented institutions - libraries and information
centers - the progress reviews in this volume provide grounds for
optimism.  Some of the trends that were commented on in Volume 6
have proved to be solid and important.  For example, the movement
toward rapid interactive access to major public and commercial data bases 
is not very strong, and it will probably not be many years before
satisfying experience with this new mode of information access will
help it become not merely an experimental innovation but the
standard means of searching and using centrally (or regionally)
held data.  Three chapters in this volume touch on related aspects 
of the movement: Bennett's review of the user interface in interactive
systems, Gechman's report on machine-readable bibliographic data bases, and
Brandhorst and Eckert's review of document retrieval and dissemination
systems.
  This volume also introduces a new Annual Review topic of potentially
great importance for future libraries: video cartridges and cassettes.
It is widely accepted that libraries and information centers will, in
the coming years, shift the balance of their holdings in the direction of
some of the newer media, and the chapter by Kletter and Hudson helps to define 
the potential and problems of some of the promising new media.  Other new
areas of interest are information system applications in the criminal
justice system and information system applications in the humanities.
  In addition to these topics, this volume covers three of the core areas
of information science, which we attempt to review on as close to an
annual basis as possible: information needs and uses, document description
and representation, and organization of information.  This
coverage is consistent with a newly developed Annual Review master
plan for cyclic but flexible coverage of some 40 major areas of interest
in library and information science.

The User Interface in Interactive Systems
.A
Bennett, J.L.
.W
  The digital computer has been used as a problem-solving tool for only
two decades.  During most of this time, computer scientists have
concentrated on learning how to build the tool: applying electronic
technology, arranging for data flow between components, and manufacturing
the hardware.  Now we are entering a new stage in which computing
power is made available through interactive terminals to people who
are not computer scientists.  This is possible on a large scale only
because design and marketing innovators now have confidence in their
ability to provide reliable, cost-effective service to less sophisticated
users.  In this new stage, the natural behavior patterns of users become
an important element in the design of the interface to the tool.

Machine-Readable Bibliographic Data Bases
.A
Gechman, Marvin C.
.W
   The advent of machine-readable data bases is one of the most significant 
forward steps in information retrieval.. Currently, the creation and 
application of these data bases are in a period of very rapid growth.. This
reviewer sees a great need for a review of "what is going on" because there is 
so much going on.. It is the goal of this chapter to fulfill that need even 
though it is difficult to hold this dynamic field static for a good meaningful 
look..

Annual Reviews of Information Science and Technology
.A
Cuadra, C.A.
.B
1974
.W
  The major trends of the 1970's in information system planning and
services are becoming clear, as indicated in this year's Annual Review
chapters.  The movement toward inter-institutional operations, or networking,
began gaining force in the 1965-1970 period, through the establishment
of many new library consortia, and there were some tentative efforts
to use computers for nationwide bibliographic information "utilities."
These movements are now more vigorous and are showing signs of being
cost-effective, productive ventures.  Inter-institutional cooperation not only
promises service improvements and cost reductions, but also poses new
problems and demands.  Formalized cooperation among different institutions
requires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importance
to a clear understanding of the information needs of specific user
subgroups.  It also requires more careful and productive system planning
and design, including intelligent consideration of the "make versus buy"
issue.  Several chapters in this volume touch on these problems and
considerations.
  One of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growth
in the use of on-line information retrieval services - both those operated
by the federal government and those operated by the private sector.  The
apparent cost-effectiveness of these services is raising some of the same
problems for data base producers that inter-institutional cooperation among
library and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printed
materials: namely, how to cover rising costs in the face of declining (or less
rapidly growing) sales of individual units of the product - monographs,
serials, secondary information publications, or magnetic tapes.  The
inclusion of a chapter on copyright - the first in the Annual Review series -
reflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over the
ownership and distribution of information.  Another aspect of that
controversy - the role of government and non-profit information services
in relation to those of private industry - is explored in this year's
chapter on document retrieval systems and techniques.

Use of Machine-Readable Data Bases
.A
Williams, M.E.
.W
  This is the first Annual Review chapter entitled "Use of Machine-
Readable Data Bases."  Therefore, the coverage provided is for more than
a one-year period.  A chapter by Gechman (79) on machine-readable
bibliographic data bases included literature from 1969 through 1971.  A
chapter by Housman (100) covered the use of data bases for selective
dissemination of information (SDI) and a chapter by Parkins & Kennedy
(153) has previously reviewed secondary information services.  This
chapter will cover the 1973 literature on data bases as well as earlier
data base papers not treated in prior chapters.
  For purposes of this chapter, a data base is considered to be an
organized set of machine-readable records containing bibliographic
or document-related data.

Design and Evaluation of Information Systems
.A
Swanson, R.W.
.W
  The co-joining of "design" with "evaluation" that is called for by this
chapter posed organizational and inclusion-exclusion problems for the
author.  In part, "design" and "evaluation" prescribe two separate sets
of activities, the former pertaining to the planning, development, and
testing of new information system structures and modification of existing
structures, the latter to appraisals and assessments of operational
systems and system components.  However, "design" includes not only the
formulation of goals and objectives for systems but also provisions for
evaluation in accordance with expectations.  "Evaluation" applies to
testing design concepts and to trying out preliminary implementations
for the purpose of improving initial designs, as well as to the
appraisal of operating systems.  Appraisals at any stage of system
operability may yield data that indicate the need for system modifications
that require redesign and assessment.  Thus, portions of "design" and
"evaluation" are closely interrelated, as Katter demonstrated in
his 1969 review.
  "Design" and "evaluation" may be examined methodologically or with
respect to outcomes of the application of methodologies.  Increasingly,
designers and evaluators have been acknowledging the dependence of
outcomes on sound procedural conceptualizations.  The current literature
discloses research on the processes of design and evaluation as well as on
their products.

Generation and Uses of Machine-Readable Data Bases
.A
Schipma, P.B.
.W
  This chapter continues the coverage of the generation and use of
machine-readable data bases inaugurated in Volume 9 by Williams (178).  It
is therefore an update consisting primarily of 1974 material and is prepared
in general accordance with Williams's initial compilation.
  The same definition of data bases and the boundaries of their applications
used in Volume 9 are continued this year.  A data base is considered
to be an organized collection of machine-readable records containing
bibliographic and/or document-related data (e.g., index information).
The data bases that we will consider are used for information storage
and retrieval and/or research in information storage and retrieval or
data base generation.
  The choice of these constraints precludes coverage of several areas.  First,
data bases primarily concerned with numerical or other nonbibliographic
information, such as chemical structures, (Milen et al., 112) are excluded.
Thus, even though the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number
is a data element common to many bibliographic data bases, papers such as
that by CAS regarding progress in building the Registry System itself (39)
are excluded.  Similarly, though some textual and bibliographic material
is included in the Systems Consultants, Inc report (156) to the Navy, most
of the information retrieval is concerned with miniaturized hardware in a
shipboard environment and thus is not considered within the scope of this
chapter.  Finally, though many of the data bases are used for generation
of publications via phototypesetting, we are not considering that production
operation.

Cooperation in Information Activities Through International Organizations
.A
Adams, S.
Werdel,J.A.
.W
  International cooperation in the processing, sharing, and transfer of
scientific and technical information takes many forms and can be
accomplished through many agencies.  This chapter proposes to review
the role played by international organizations in stimulating and
providing channels and mechanisms for such cooperation.  The international
organizations to be discussed are of two types: intergovernmental organizations
(IGOs), in which member nations participate through their governments under
formal treaties or agreements; and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
where, with some exceptions, participation is through national professional
societies or nongovernmental institutions.  The specialized agencies of the
United Nations, including UNESCO, fall in the first category; organizations
such as the International Federation for Documentation (FID) are in the
second.

Introduction to the ADI Annual Review
.A
Cuadra, C.A.
.B
1966
.W
  Over the past 15 or 20 years, a new and growing field of inquiry
has begun to take shape.  This field, which will be referred to as "Information
Science and Technology," draws on fragments and fringes of a number
of sciences, technologies, disciplines, arts, and practices.  The element
that provides whatever degree of cohesiveness now exists in the field is a
shared deep concern with "information" - its generation, transformation,
communication, storage, retrieval, and use.
  Because of the universality of information processes, and also because
of the variety of backgrounds of those concerned with them, there is very
little agreement about the boundaries of Information Science and Technology,
or about its parentage, its essential nature, or its future.  To put it
simply, at the present time there is no clearly defined and well-understood
field of Information Science and Technology.  There is not, truth to tell,
even clear agreement on what the word "information" itself means and
particularly on whether it implies a creative act of the intellect or a
commodity that can be embodied in documents, transported, and exchanged.
Distressing as this ambiguity and lack of agreement may be, they need
not and do no preclude a constructive review of topics of current interest
to users, designers, and students of information systems and services.
The purpose of the ADI Annual Review series, initiated in this volume,
is to provide such a review.

Information Needs and Uses in Science and Technology
.A
Menzel, H.
.W
The way in which scientists and engineers make use of the information
systems at their disposal, the demands that they put to them, the
satisfaction achieved by their efforts, and the resultant impact on their
further work are among the items of knowledge which are necessary for the wise
planning of science information systems and policy.  Besides, these
matters can be of great significance to the behavioral scientist interested
in human organization and communication.  While "user studies" have
not yet gone very far in serving either of these functions, the end of 1963
seems to have been something of a take-off point for empirical research
on the information needs and uses of scientists and technologists.  For
this first volume of the Annual Review, we shall therefore cover studies that
made their appearance as far back as the last month of 1963, to give the
reader a rounded picture of a period during which this area of research
has witnessed progress along the following lines:
    Substantial advances in the more systematic and fruitful application
  of a technique (critical incidents) that had made its appearance in
  this field earlier in less rigorous forms;
    The introduction of at least two very promising approaches (solution
  development records; comparison of research teams working on identical
  tasks) quite different from any that had been applied to this field before; 
  and
    An increase in the number of efforts at comprehensive study of the
  information-flow situation in given disciplines, one of which [American
  Psychological Association (3)] has become the model and envy of research
  in this area.

Evaluation of Information Systems and Services
.A
Rees, A.M.
.W
  This chapter summarizes and discusses the present state of the art in
testing and evaluation.  Three tasks will be undertaken: to outline in
some detail the few substantive research projects involving testing and
evaluation, to describe a number of research projects in areas cognate to
testing and evaluation, and finally, to provide some general conclusions
with respect to past and future activity.  Although a distinction is made
in this review between laboratory-based experimentation and tests of
operational systems, the methodology used in each instance is substantially
the same.  As yet, no full-scale and elaborate field approach has been
attempted.

Design of Information Systems and Services
.A
Borko, H.
.W
  This review has selected for emphasis reports on concepts of systems
analysis and on the procedures for applying these concepts to the design
of information systems.  Literature dealing with the automation of libraries
and information centers has been explicitly excluded, while material on
user studies, file organization, evaluation, etc., is only mentioned briefly
since it is covered more thoroughly in other chapters.
  The selected, relevant, and available literature that has been published
in the last year or so is organized into four groups as follows:
     1. Articles that help define the process of systems analysis and
     the relationship to information science.
     2. Articles that describe the concepts of systems analysis as
     applied to the analysis and design of information systems.
     3. Articles primarily concerned with the design of document
     storage and retrieval systems.

The Annual Review of Information Science and Technology
.A
Cuadra, C.A.
.B
1968
.W
  The Annual Review of Information Science and Technology is now in its
third year.  Like its two predecessors, this volume attempts to describe and
evaluate the most significant work that has been reported in the field
during the past year, with the ultimate aim of improving both our standards
and our means of professional communication.
  The field of information science and technology continues to evolve and
grow.  As it does, new areas of interest emerge and established areas of
interest change in importance.  Accordingly, our pattern of coverage
changes.  The single chapter on Automation in Libraries and Information
Centers, in Volume 2, has been expanded into two chapters, one covering 
automation of technical processes and the other covering document
networks, and a new chapter has been added on information system
applications in education.  Such applications are important not just because
they involve, in part, libraries and other information facilities but
because they highlight innovative ideas and techniques that should be of
value to anyone interested in the total communication process.
   At the same time, "core" chapters of the review are continued:  information
needs and uses; content analysis, specification, and control; file organization
and search; publication and distribution techniques; automated language
processing; man-machine communication; information system design and evaluation;
and professional aspects of information science.
These topics are of continuing and vital interest to our readers, and their
annual literature is significant, large, and growing.

Information Needs and Uses
.A
Paisley, W.J.
.W
  Information science meets behavioral science in the study of information
needs and uses.  At first, the meeting of these fields was inconclusive.  Until
the mid-1960's, there were only a few substantial studies of information
needs and uses.  Since about 1963, however, a significant literature has
grown rapidly.
  There is evidence now of a productive entente between the fields.
When information scientists see reliable, valid, and nontrivial data on
users' behavior, they begin to use behavioral criteria in evaluating
information system performance.  When behavioral scientists glimpse the
full complexity of dissemination, documentation, storage, and retrieval
processes, they offer fewer naive solutions to "the information problem."
  This mutual education and accommodation will undoubtedly continue.
Information science and behavioral science need each other.  Big Science
needs them both.

The Annual Review of Information Science and Technology
.A
Cuadra, C.A.
.B
1969
.W
  This, the fourth volume of the Annual Review of Information Science and
Technology, is both like and unlike its predecessors.  The basic objective -
to provide the most comprehensive and technically sound progress review
ever prepared in the information science field - remains the same, as do the
basic areas of interest and coverage.  Too, the primary emphasis continues
to be on published literature and reports, to permit the reader to identify,
locate, and examine interesting and important sources of information
about various aspects of our technical progress.
  Some new areas of growing importance are introduced this year.  For the
first time, a chapter on reprography and microfilm technology and one on
the international aspects of information transfer have been included.  Also,
the topics of document dissemination and the secondary services, usually
covered in parts of other chapters, have full and separate chapters this
year.  Another change, made in response to suggestions from readers for better
signposts within each volume, is the division of the book into several
major segments, each introduced by a short description of the contents of
the section, the relationships among the chapters within it, and, in some
instances, one or two highlights of the year's technical progress.

Information Needs and Uses
.A
Allen, T.J.
.W
  Previous authors in this series, writing on this subject, have usually felt 
it necessary to begin with a statement concerning the state of the
methodology of "user" studies.  They have, for the most part, found it
improved over the past, and this year is no exception in that regard.
There remains, however, the tendency on the part of many who are untrained
in social science methodology to assume that the art of questionnaire design
and administration is a very simple one that anyone with intelligence can
master in a single attempt.  One never realizes how truly wrong this view is
until he finds himself the author of a review chapter and is then confronted
with the sort of trivia that many authors submit as research papers.

Annual Review of Information Science and Technology
.A
Cuadra, C.A.
.B
1970
.W
  The field of information science and technology continues to grow
and, as it grows, to show new emphases and explore new areas of interest.
Volume 5 reflects these changes.  The increasing interest in
and movement toward library networks and other cooperative,
technology-supported information activities have helped to focus
special attention not only on data processing and microfilm technology,
the two traditional mainstays of library and document-handling systems,
but also on the rapidly developing capabilities in modern tele-communications.
Thus, a chapter on communication technology has appeared, for the first
time, to bring readers up to date on changes in the communications industry
that have had or will have a great impact on how we design and use
information-handling systems.
  Two other first-time chapters cover management information systems
and information systems in state and local government.  While
the intent behind the development of such systems, and the kinds of
services they provide, is peripheral to the purposes and services of
library and document-handling systems, one often sees in these peripheral
areas some information parallels.  Indeed, one of the reasons for the
Annual Review's covering one or more of these areas each year is to
help its readers exploit more fully the thinking and the problem-solving
techniques they are fostering.

Application of Computer Technology to Library Process: a syllabus
.A
Becker, J.
.W
  The application of computer technology to library and
network processes and services is not an end in itself, but
rather a means of narrowing the gap between the demand
for library services and the ability of libraries to provide
those services.  Libraries have assumed the active role of
serving the informational, educational and recreational needs
of the population.  The size of that population grows constantly,
its educational level keeps climbing, and its percentage of
leisure time is increasing.
  The application of computer technology to libraries,
especially to the manipulation of bibliographic records in
the performance of library functions, is a complex process
and demands the highest level of talent of both the library
and computer professions for its accomplishment.  It cannot be
accomplished by either profession alone; rather, the design
of a library system is a team effort between librarians,
computer system analysts, and programmers.  Even a
limited effort demands careful long-term planning if it is to
fit with later efforts into a cohesive whole.  The smallest
project will affect nearly all operations of the library.  For
these reasons it is necessary that all library staff have at
least a general overview of what library automation is all
about.

  A distinct characteristic of man is the need to communicate and
record knowledge.  The tools of communication have ranged from clay to
satellites.  Civilized societies have taken great pains to place recorded
knowledge in safe places and create archives and libraries for this
purpose.
  The importance of recorded knowledge for survival and progress is
constantly being elevated as more and more information is presented.
Without information and its necessary control, a society is not only
stagnant, but regressive.  With social memory, preserved and controlled
by archives and libraries, a society is able to evolve to whatever future it
is destined to experience in an ever-changing environment.
  Archives were the forerunners of libraries.  The ancient archives
contained the best of society's accumulated knowledge; and as nations
grew in wealth and security, archives and libraries become symbols of a
country's aspiration to create a better society.  Today, archives and
libraries are necessities.  These cultural institutions pass information to
succeeding generations in a variety of forms of distributable media.  In this
way, archives and libraries preserve the memory of civilization and pass
this memory on to living individuals.  The materials in these institutions
contain the written and graphic record of social memory and human
heritage and provide society with information on which to base actions,
develop policies, ascertain rights, educate, and entertain.

The Area Specialist Bibliographer: an inquiry into his role 
.A
Stuart, R.D.
.W
  It is the intent of this volume to develop a model designed
to eliminate present difficulties and ambiguities and
to improve administrative procedures for future development
of area programs.  This will be accomplished by giving
some indication of the climate of opinion toward area specialist
bibliographers and by isolating factors which influence
these opinions.  These attitudes will be presented by the
perceptions of area bibliographers toward their role and the
expectations of faculty and library administrators toward that
role.  The bibliographer's academic, professional, and
educational experience will be examined in this framework.

The Art of Computer Programming
.A
Knuth, D.E.
.W
  The process of preparing programs for a digital computer is especially
attractive because it not only can be economically and scientifically
rewarding, it can also be an aesthetic experience much like composing
poetry or music.  This book is the first volume of a seven-volume set
of books that has been designed to train the reader in the various skills
which go into a programmer's craft.

ASIDIC Survey of Information Center Services
.A
Williams, M.E.
.W
     The data in that survey covered the year 1971.  Many recipients
of the 1972 document have requested updated information.  Accordingly,
the ASIDIC Cooperative Data Management Committee initiated a new survey.
The questionnaires were mailed out in January of 1975 and responses
came in throughout the year.  Questionnaires were sent to all member
organizations of ASIDIC and EUSIDIC.  Questionnaires were also sent
to individual members of ASIS SIG/SDI and SIG/UOI.
     Responses received throughout 1975 were checked and tabulated in
1976.  Because of the time delay in producing the final compilation
the reader is warned against using this survey as an up-to-date source
for information as to which centers are processing which data bases.
     Of the 116 responding organizations 75 process data bases and
41 use data base services either as end users or as brokers.  Of the 75
that process data bases (i.e., spin tapes) 51 (68%) are members of ASIDIC
and/or EUSIDIC.  This survey provides representative data for data base
processing organizations.  The use of online search services was
relatively new in 1974 hence data regarding online users would not be
representative of the 1976 online situation.

Research on Users' Needs: Where is it Getting Us?
.A
Hanson, C.W.
.W
  Since Bernal made his pilot survey of the use of scientific literature
for the 1948 Royal Society Scientific Information Conference, at least
three dozen other investigations have been reported of the needs of
scientists and engineers for information, of their information gathering
habits, and the use to which they put information.
  Some of these have been concerned with the people in individual
organizations, but have implications elsewhere.  Others, including
Aslib's own investigations, have had wider aims.  Some have been
based upon observations and records of what the scientists and
engineers themselves did or said, and some upon records of the demands
they made upon libraries.  There have been both surveys of opinions,
and collections of facts.

The Cranfield Tests on Index Language Devices

   The investigation dealt with the effect which different devices have on the
performance of index languages.. It appeared that the most important 
consideration was the specificity of the index terms; within the context of the
conditions existing in this test, single-word terms were more effective than 
concept terms or a controlled vocabulary..

Current Awareness Searches on CT, CBAS and ASCA
.A
Abbot, M.T.J.
Hunter, P.S.
Simkins, M.A.
.W
  During the past year we have been one of the organizations
participating in the Chemical Society's experiment on the use
of routine computer searches of Chemical Titles (CT) and Chemical-
Biological Activities (CBAC) for current awareness.  For some
time we have also been subscribing to the Automatic Subject Citation
Alert (ASCA), which is produced by the Institute for Scientific
Information as a by-product of the Science Citation Index.  These
three sources differ in their scope and methods, but share the
same ultimate objective of providing a computer-based current
awareness service.
  CT covers journals in all branches of chemistry, but provides only
authors and titles, the latter translated into American and edited by 
breaking down complex words so that word fragments can be retrieved.
CBAC covers only papers on the interaction of chemical compounds with
biological systems, but provides abstracts which are available for
computer search.  The computer can also search for molecular
formulae and for Chemical Abstracts registry numbers of all
compounds included in the abstracts.  ASCA in its original form
was based on citations: the search profile can consist of a list of
references to older work, and the output is then a list of new papers
citing this work.  Last spring ASCA introduced a 'term search', which
is a search for words in the titles of current papers and is therefore
analogous to a CT search.
  This paper discusses and compares the results we have obtained so
far with these three services, and the potential use of systems of
this type.

Thesaurus Compilation Methods:  A Literature Review
.A
Blagden, J.F.
.W
  This review has been sponsored by the Office for Scientific
and Technical Information and the end product of the complete
research will be a thesaurus of management terms.  Parallel research
in the business management area and also supported by OSTI is being 
conducted by David Dews, Librarian of the Manchester Business School,
and K.D.C. Vernon, Librarian of the London Graduate School of
Business Studies.  As Mr. Vernon is at present engaged in the
construction of a faceted classification scheme for management,
this investigation has concentrated on the possibility of utilizing
faceted techniques to construct such a thesaurus.
  A study of existing information retrieval systems in the
management field has already been made, so a decision to adopt
some form of post-co-ordinate indexing was assumed.  Thus a comparative
study of other systems will not be attempted.  A decision has also
already been made that a controlled vocabulary, i.e. a thesaurus,
was eventually going to be developed despite the latest Cranfield
results that appear to provide evidence of the superiority of
natural language over controlled vocabularies.  This was primarily
because these results were restricted to tests on an aeronautical
collection, and it may well be that the natural language of this
discipline is in itself a fairly controlled one, which is
certainly not the case with the rather 'soft' language of
management.  This is borne out to some extent by Halkin, who
quotes relevance figures for coordinate indexing applied to organic
chemistry (55 percent), engineering (35 percent), and social
science (20 per cent).
  Machine methods of term generation as described by Ovchinnikov,
Mastermann and Luhn will not be considered, as there is no equipment
available to prepare thesauri on the lines these authors suggest.

Criteria for Evaluating Technical Library Effectiveness
.A
Wessel, C.J.
.W
  In July 1966 John I. Thompson & Company accepted a contract with the
Picatinny Arsenal, US Department of the Army, to perform a study aimed
at developing 'Criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of library
operations and services' under the ATLIS Program (Army Technical
Library Improvement Studies).  The study was divided into three
phases aimed at:
    I A Literature search to reflect the current 'state-of-the
      art' covering library standards and the methods of evaluating
      libraries developed up to the present.
   II A phase in which to gather and evaluate any data required from
      Army Technical Libraries, from available surveys already
      published, or from any other sources, by which to develop
      criteria.
  III A phase in which to establish and validate the criteria.
  Phases I and II of the study are now complete.  Phase III is in progress
and is expected to be completed by the late fall of 1968.  The reports of
Phases I and II are already available for detailed study and that of
Phase III will be available soon.  The purpose of this paper is to present
some of the findings of the study.

The UDC in its International Aspects
.A
Lloyd, G.A.
.W
  Universal Decimal Classification - dying duck or live bird? - or some
such title - was suggested to me, but this is highly debatable, and there will
hardly be time for the duck-shooters to develop a concerted onslaught in the
half-hour or so allowed us for discussion.  Besides, I hope to be able to
convince you - if the BSI's fine efforts have not already done so - that the
UDC is by no means the dying duck - certainly not the dead duck - that some of
its severest critics seem to imagine.  Perhaps the bird has ceased to soar as
it once did in the times of Otlet, La Fontaine, Bradford and Donker Duyvis, but
that it is still viable in the turbulent air of current documentation may be
gauged from a recent FID inquiry aimed at obtaining figures for the
distribution of UDC editions and an approximate estimate of the number of
users throughout the world.

Subject Relations in Science/Technology Literature
.A
Earle, P.
Vickery, B.
.W
  The analysis of citations has often been employed to indicate the use
of the literature of science and technology.  Citation is only an indicator
of use, not an accurate measure, and like all such indicators has defects.
Differences between indicators have been discussed elsewhere.
  Despite these defects, an examination of citations does enable one to
sample acts of literature use within a large community.  The study reported
here was directed, in fact, to all United Kingdom authors of science/
technology publications in a given year, and because of its width, and the type
of analysis performed, is considered to be worth reporting.  The study was
primarily undertaken to obtain comparable information about social science
literature, and this has been reported elsewhere.

Letter to the Editor:  Assessment of Information Services
.A
Davison, P.s.
.W
  May we please raise four questions which are important at the present time
when government policy on information retrieval is being considered? These
arise from results recently produced by SDC which are germane to Dr.
Somerfield's paper on 'Computer-based Information Services' (Aslib
Proceedings, 20, 12, 542-50 (1968)), and to OSTI's work in this field.
  The SDC is making comparisons of the efficiency of various published
indexes and other sources of scientific information and the first results
of rigorously checked comparisons are becoming available for a case study
on the subject of 'Computers Related to Mass Spectrometry'.  This results
from an extensive literature search prepared by combining and collating
results of searches in twelve of the world's major indexes to chemistry and
spectroscopy, including searches of SDC's own data bank files.  Nearly
two hundred unique references on 'Computers Related to Mass Spectrometry'
were found and are being checked individually for relevance going back
to the original paper or asking expert opinion where necessary.

On the Design of Information Systems for Human Beings
.A
Line, M.B.
.W
  Planning of any kind can be motivated by a pressing practical problem which
has to be solved - for example, an increasing number of people may have to be
housed in the same area; or by a long-term idealistic vision; or by both
(the idealist seeing the long-term implications of an immediate problem).  In
short-term planning, the danger exists that the more technical problems may be
solved, without attention to their implications for human beings; to take
my housing example, higher and higher flats may be built, without considering
the possible effects (e.g. the effect on social groupings).  In long-term
planning, Utopian or ideological blueprints may be produced.

Standard Costing for Information Systems:
Background to a Current Study
.A
Robertson, S.E.
Reynolds, R.
Wilkin, A.P.
.W
  For some time past, interest has been developing within the Aslib Research
Department in the problems of establishing standard costs for information
systems.  A literature search recently conducted by the Department (R.
Reynolds) has revealed a scarcity of usable information on this subject:
such data as is available is difficult to evaluate comparatively because
of the differing definitions of the operations costed and of the terms used to
describe them.  It would seem, therefore, that a first step towards developing
a costing method of widespread application would be the establishment of
standard conventions for the analysis of information systems.
  One might postulate two possible ways of arriving at comparative costs for
these systems, namely:
(a) General survey method:  The overall costs of a large number of information
    systems are broken down into a small number of categories, and analysed
    for correlation (see, for example, C.J. Wessel et al).
(b) In-depth study:  A small number of systems are studied in detail in an
    attempt to establish the true sources of the costs and factors affecting
    them.
  In a current project, we are attempting to apply method (b) to the production
of current-awareness bulletins.  An outline of some of the preliminary work in
this project follows.

An Information Retrieval Language for MARC
.A
Austin, D.
.W
  I see from the programme that I am supposed to talk on an information  
language for MARC, and it is true that the work I have been doing for the past
year or so has been under the auspices of the MARC Project.  But the subject
indexing system we have developed is concerned as much with BNB's plans for
computer production from 1971 as with the MARC tapes as such, and I hope to
show that we have also gone some way towards developing a compatible
general system with even wider application.  Before coming to this, however, it
is necessary to describe briefly some of the day to day pressures of work which
caused BNB to look to the computer for help.  From this we can see how the
computer forced us to reconsider our whole approach to subject indexing.

Analysis and Organization of Knowledge for Retrieval
.A
Farradane, J.E.L.
.W
  In a university, the mode of research is usually what is called 'pure' or
'basic' research; since I am keeping in mind primarily the applications of
information science, I will prefer the word 'basic', although there is not so 
much difference.  In such research, and really in any good research, one should
not be collecting data haphazardly.  One must isolate and define a problem and,
as far as possible, control other conditions so that interfering factors are
eliminated.  Preferably one will narrow down the problem to manageable
proportions.  It is then essential to approach the problem with some sort of
hypothesis or theory of the situation, and to concentrate on obtaining
evidence for or against that hypothesis.  The important task is to devise just 
that crucial experiment which will give the answer as efficiently as possible.
If the answer disproves the hypothesis, one has at least further evidence upon
which to construct a different hypothesis; if it confirms the hypothesis, one
is ready for a further step forward, and so on.  Research is easier in a
fully controlled and reproducible situation; in a biological or human
situation one must often have recourse to statistical methods, but this does
not alter the general methodology.  On the whole, I find a clear methodology
lacking in much that is being done in the field of information science today.

User Studies:  A Review of the Literature from 1966 to 1970
.A
Wood, D.N.
.W
  My terms of reference when asked to prepare this review of user studies were
to bring Fishenden's work up to date.  This was published in the Journal of 
Documentation in September 1965 and in his paper he looks at a limited number
of British use studies and draws some broad general conclusions relating to the
development of a national information service.  The present paper which covers
the literature back to the beginning of 1966 is somewhat more detailed.  It
considers a wide range of investigations into the information gathering habits 
of scientists, engineers, social scientists and others, and reports results 
which it is hoped will provide managers with information on which to develop
policies regarding library and information services at all levels.  Although
an increasing number of studies is being carried out in Eastern Europe and
in the USSR there has been no major work reported and consequently the review
considers mainly British and American investigations.

Library and Information Science Abstracts: The First Two Years

Gilcrist, A.
Presanis, A.

  With the thirteenth issue affected by the recent postal strike, now seems
an opportune moment to take a look at the performance of LISA in its first two

Abstracts in 1969 as a joint venture between the Library Association and Aslib.
A recount of its birth and a brief report on early progress both appeared in
1969.
